1. [[MY || 3]] WIFE HAS VISITED [[SUSAN MERLE || 1]] IN THE HOSPITAL, SINCE HOSPITAL HAS JUST GONE ON STRIKE AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT SERVICES ARE MINIMAL. [[WE||2]] WILL PROVIDE [[HER || 1]] WITH FOOD AND OTHER NECESSITIES THROUGHOUT THE STRIKE, WHICH [[WE||2]] ANTICIPATE WILL LAST ONLY FEW DAYS.


2. CONCERNING SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUESTED PARA 2 REFTEL#: [[MS MERLE ||1]] IS DOING VERY WELL AND PROGNOSIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE VERY GOOD. [[WE||2]] HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET IN CONTACT WITH DOCTOR SO FAR, BUT [[MY || 3]] WIFE WILL VISIT HOSPITAL AGAIN TOMORROW TO TALK TO HIM. DOCTOR DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AND IS VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE, SO PERHAPS BEST [[WE||2]] ACT AS INTERMEDIARY. [[PATIENT||1]] CANNOT BE CALLED DIRECTLY.


3. PARENTS CAN CALL US IN THE EVENINGS THIS WEEKEND IF WISH TO RECEIVE MORE NEWS AND MESSAGES. TELEPHONE NUMBER IS: 040 - 910535.
