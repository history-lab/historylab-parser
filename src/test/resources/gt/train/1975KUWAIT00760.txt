1. [[[[KUWAIT || 1]] DAILY [[AS SIYASA || 2]] EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AND OWNER, AHMED JARALLA || 3]], WAS IN [[AMMAN || 4]] FEBRUARY 5, AND IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT [[HE || 3]] SAW [[KING HUSSEIN || 5]] AND OTHERS IN [[JORDAN || 14]] POWER STRUCTURE. TO DATE NO REPORTS HAVE APPEARED IN [[THIS PAPER || 2]] COMING FROM RECENT TRIP, BUT ON TWO PREVIOUS OCCASIONS IN PAST FOUR YEARS, [[AS SIYASA || 2]]  PUBLISHED [[JARALLA || 3]] INTERVIEWS WITH [[KING ||5]]. FOR AT LEAST ONE INTER- VIEW, [[HE || 3]] WAS INVITED TO [[AMMAN || 4]]  BY OR THROUGH [[THEN MINISTER OF INFORMATION ABU ODEH || 6]]. [[GOI ||7]] CONSIDERED [[AS SIYASA || 2]] USEFUL VEHICLE TO GET [[JORDAN'S || 14]] VIEWS TO [[ARAB WORLD || 10]]. [[THIS PAPER || 2]] IS NO MORE PRO-[[PLO || 8]] THAN OTHERS IN [[KUWAIT ||1]] , AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT MOTIVE WOULD BE TO EMBARRASS [[JORDAN || 14]].


2. TO [[EMBASSY'S || 9]] KNOWLEDGE, [[JARALLA || 3]] HAS NO SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH [[PLO LEADERSHIP || 8]]. IT SEEMS STRANGE [[PLO LEADERS || 8]] WOULD SELECT [[HIM ||3]] FOR SUCH MISSION, EVEN IF ONLY TRIAL BALLOON. THOUGH FAIRLY DYNAMIC NEWSMAN, [[HE || 3]] IS CONSIDERED OPPORTUNIST. ADDITIONALLY, [[PLO OFFICE AND OFFICIALS || 8]] IN [[KUWAIT || 1]] ARE REMOVED FROM [[ORGANIZA- TION'S || 8]] MAIN POLITICAL POLICY DETERMINATION. [[OUR || 9]] GUESS IS THAT [[JARALLA || 3]] WAS ON FISHING EXPEDITION OF [[HIS || 3]] OWN MAKING OR USED INFORMATION [[HE || 3]] RECEIVED FROM [[PLO || 8]] AND OTHER SOURCES AS HAVING MORE BACKING AND SANCTION THAN IN FACT IS CASE. IN SUM, [[WE || 9]] TEND DISCOUNT SIGNIFICANCE WHAT [[HE || 3]] TOLD [[RIFA'I || 15]], EVEN THOUGH SOME [[ARAB LEADERS || 11]] WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH [[HUSSEIN || 5]] AND [[JORDAN ||14]] IN [[WEST BANK || 12]] IF THIS WERE FEASIBLE IN CONTEXT OF CURRENT POLITICS AND PUBLIC OPINION IN [[ARAB WORLD || 10]].


3. THIS CABLE HELD IN [[KUWAIT || 1]] UNTIL MINIMIZE LIFTED.
