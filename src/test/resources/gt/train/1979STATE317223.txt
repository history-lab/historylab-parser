1. (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT.)


2. [[EMBASSY ||1]] SHOULD PASS FOLLOWING REPORT TO [[COSSIGA || 2]] ON VISITS TO [[WASHINGTON || 3]] OF [[[[NORWEGIAN || 4]] AND [[DUTCH  || 5]] PRIME MINISTERS  || 6]] AND [[[[DANISH  || 7]]FOREIGN MINISTER || 8]], DECEMBER 7. [[EMBASSY ||1]] SHOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT [[WE || 9]] ARE GIVING [[GOI ||21]] AN ESPECIALLY DETAILED BRIEFING IN VIEW OF THE KEY ROLE [[ITALY  ||10 ]] IS PLAYING IN CUR- RENT [[NATO || 11]] DECISION, AND THAT THE REPORT SHOULD THEREFORE BE VERY CLOSELY HELD.


3. IN MEETING WITH [[VICE PRESIDENT MONDALE || 12]], SECRETARIES [[VANCE || 13]] AND [[BROWN  || 14]], AND [[DR. BRZEZINSKI || 15]], [[[[NORWEGIAN || 4]] PM NORDLI || 16]] OFFERED A CLEAR EXPOSITION OF [[HIS  || 16]] POSITION, NOTING TNF WAS VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE IN [[NORWAY || 17]] AND HAD AROUSED EMOTIONAL AND BROAD-BASED OPPOSITION. IN COURSE OF CONVERSATIONS, HOWEVER, [[NORDLI || 16]] INDICATED THAT [[GON || 4]] HAS LEEWAY TO JOIN CONSENSUS ON DECEMBER 12, HAVING RETAINED A "FREE HAND" IN [[HIS  || 16]] DEALINGS WITH [[[[HIS  || 16]] PARTY  || 18]] AND [[PARLIAMENT || 19]]. [[NORDLI || 16]] STATED THAT A MODERNIZATION DECISION, INCLUDING DEPLOYMENTS, WAS NECESSARY AND WAS BEST WAY TO GET ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS UNDERWAY. [[US OFFICIALS || 20]] CONFIRMED[[OUR||9]] DETERMINATION TO MAKE A CLEAR AND FIRM DECISION ON DECEMBER 12 TO PROCEED WITH THE RECOMMENDED MODERNIZATION PROGRAM AND CONTROL APPROACH. [[WE||9]] ARE OPTIMISTIC AS A RESULT OF THIS VISIT THAT [[NORWAY||17]] WILL SUPPORT THE TNF DECISION. [[THE NORWEGIANS ||4]]  DISCUSSED [[THEIR||4]] INTEREST IN IMPROVING PRESENTATIONAL ASPECTS OF DECEMBER 12 DECISION BY GIVING GREATER PROMINENCE TO ARMS CONTROL. [[THEY ||4]] OUTLINED [[THEIR ||4]] THINKING ON HOW THIS MIGHT BE DONE THROUGH COSMETIC CHANGE IN THE COMMUNIQUE. AS [[WE||9]] UNDERSTAND [[THEM||4]], THE SORT OF CHANGE [[THE NORWEGIANS||4]] HAVE IN MIND IS MINOR AND NON-SUBSTANTIVE, THOUGH APPARENTLY QUITE IMPORTANT FOR ENSURING [[NORWEGIAN||17]] SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH [[WE||9]] WILL IN GENERAL STOUTLY RESIST CHANGES IN THE IDD OR COMMUNIQUE, [[WE||9]] THINK THE IDEA [[NORWEGIANS||4]] MAY COME UP WITH WILL PROVE AC- CEPTABLE TO [[US || 20]] AND TO [[ITALY||10]] AND WILL ENSURE [[NORWEIGIAN||17]]SUP- PORT.


5. [[[[DUTCH || 5]] PRIME MINISTER VAN AGT || 22]] AND [[FOREIGN MINISTER VAN DE KLAAUW  || 23]] MET BRIEFLY WITH [[PRESIDENT CARTER  || 24]] DECEMBER 7 BEFORE HOLDING EXTENDED DISCUSSION ON TNF WITH [[SECRETARY VANCE || 13]], [[PRESIDENTIAL ASSISTANT BRZEZINSKI  || 15]] AND OTHER [[SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS || 25]]. [[THE DUTCH  || 5]] OUTLINED THE DIFFICULTIES [[THEY ||5 ]] WOULD HAVE WITH THE DECISION, NOTING THE MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN [[THE NETHERLANDS || 26]]. [[VAN AGT  ||22 ]] ACCEPTED TOP- LEVEL ASSURANCES OF THE UNSHAKEABLE [[US || 20]] DEDICATION TO ARMS CONTROL AS PART OF AN ALLIANCE TNF DECISION. [[HE ||22]] ALSO UNDERSTANDS COMPLETELY [[OUR|| 9]] DETERMINATION TO PROCEED WITH A POSITIVE DECISION ON DECEMBER 12. [[WE||9]] OF COURSE CONTINUE TO HOPE THAT [[THE DUTCH ||5]] CAN JOIN THE CONSENSUS, WHILE RECOGNIZING [[THEY ||5]] MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO FULLY. THE [[DUTCH ||5]] DOMESTIC SITUATION IS NOW EXTREMELY FRAGILE, AND [[WE||9]] MAY NOT KNOW UNTIL WEDNESDAY HOW [[GON || 5]] WILL GO; [[WE||9]] WILL KEEP [[GOI ||21 ]] INFORMED.


6. [[[[DANISH|| 7]] FOREIGN MINISTER OLESEN || 8]], IN MEETING WITH [[SECRETARY VANCE || 13]] AND OTHER [[SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS || 25]], DID NOT ALTER [[DANISH || 7]] POSITION. HOWEVER, [[WE||9]]  STILL FEEL THAT [[DANES|| 7]] WISH TO AND MAY YET FIND A WAY TO JOIN THE CON- SENSUS ON DECEMBER 12.


7. FOR [[LONDON  || 28]] ANN: PLEASE PASS THE ABOVE TO [[MOBERLY || 30]] AND [[RUTH || 31]].
