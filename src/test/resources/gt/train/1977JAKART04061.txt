1. [[ACHMAD DJAMIRIN|| 1]], [[HEAD OF [[ECONOMIC BUREAU IN [[GOI||3 ]] ASEAN SECRETARIAT|| 2]] || 1]] AND [[MEMBER OF [[GOI DEL TO ASEAN-JAPAN FORUM || 4]]|| 1]], CON- FIRMED REPORT IN REF C THAT [[ASEAN|| 5]]  HAD INDEED BROUGHT UP [[JAPANESE|| 6]]  FINANCING FOR THE [[ASEAN|| 5]]  INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS, GREATER [[ASEAN|| 5]] ACCESS TO [[JAPANESE|| 6]] MARKETS AND COMMODITY ARRANGEMENTS. ALL WERE INCLUDED IN [[[[ASEAN||5 ]] SPOKESMAN UMARJADI'S || 8]] OPENING STATEMENT. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO [[DJAMIRIN|| 1]] , [[UMARJADI'S|| 8]]  IN- CLUSION OF THESE ITEMS WAS ISMPLY A FORMAL PLACING ON THE RECORD OF REQUESTS WITH WHICH [[THE GOU||7]]  WAS ALREADY QUITE FAMILIAR. FOR EXAMPLE [[ASEAN|| 5]] INTEREST IN [[JAPANESE|| 6]] FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS, WHICH DJAMIRIN TERMED [[ASEAN'S || 5]] NO. 1 PRIORITY VIS-A-VIS [[JAPAN ||6]], HAD ALREADY BEEN COMMUNICATED TO [[GAIMUSHO DEPUTY DIRGEN FOR [[ASEAN|| 5]] AFFAIRS EDAMURA || 9]] IN [[SINGAPORE|| 10]]  FEBRUARY 16 (REF B). [[DJAMIRIN || 1]] SAID NO DISCUSSION OF ANY OF THE [[ASEAN|| 5]]  RE- QUESTS TOOK PLACE ON MARCH 23.


2. [[DJAMIRIN || 1]] SAID THE MAIN ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE MARCH 23 SESSION WAS FORMALIZATION OF THE FORUM, AND THAT [[ASEAN|| 5]] WAS SATISFIED WITH THIS ACHIEVEMENT. [[ASEAN|| 5]] HAD KNOWN IN ADVANCE THAT [[THE JAPANESE||7]] WOULD BE UNPREPARED TO DEAL IN SPECIFICS IN THE ONE-DAY SESSION AND [[THEY|| 5]]  REALLY HOPD FOR NO MORE THAN FORMALIZATION OF THE DAILOGUE. [[DJAMIRIN || 1]] MADE CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT [[ASEAN||5]] DOES EXPECT THE PACE TO QUICKEN BEGINNING WITH THE NEXT FORUM SESSION.
