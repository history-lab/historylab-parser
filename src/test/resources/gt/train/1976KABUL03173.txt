1. SUMMARY. THE [[AFGHAN||1]] POLITICAL SCENE IN THE WEEKS FOLLOWING [[PRESIDENT DAOUD'S||2]] APPOINTMENT OF [[A COMMISSION TO REVIEW A NEW CONSTITUTION||3]] HAS BEEN UNUSUALLY QUIET. IN THIS [[TOWN||1]] OF RUMORS, SPECULATION REGARDING THE CONSTITUTION AND ITS PROVISIONS IS REMARKABLY LACKING. IN ITS PLACE IS CYNICISM ABOUT [[DAOUD'S||2]] MOTIVES AND, STRANGELY, A SPATE OF RUMORS OF COUP-PLOTTING WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO A STATE OF ENHANCED NERVOUSNESS AND TENSION. [[EMBASSY||4]] DOES NOT BELIEVE HOWEVER [[[[DAOUD||2]] REGIME||5]] IN ANY DANGER. END SUMMARY.

2. WHEN [[PRESIDENT DAOUD||2]] ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 22 THAT A NEW CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN PREPARED AND SENT TO [[A [[COMMISSION||3]] OF TWENTY MEMBERS||11]] FOR SCRUTINY ([[KABUL||1]] 2105), IT SEEMED POSSIBLE THAT A NEW CHAPTER IN [[AFGHANISTAN'S||5]] POLITICAL HISTORY WAS ABOUT TO BE WRITTEN. THIS WAS [[DAOUD'S||2]] GREATEST GESTURE TOWARD BROADENING THE CONSENSUS BY WHICH [[HE||2]] GOVERNS. YET THIS POLITICAL EVENT, WHICH COULD CONCEIVABLY HAVE OPENED POLITICAL DEBATE IN [[THE COUNTRY||1]], HAS BEEN MORE LIKE THE DROPPING OF A LARGE STONE INTO A BARREL OF OIL: THE CONSTITUTION (IF INDEED THERE IS ONE) APPEARS TO HAVE SUNK, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING, WITHOUT A TRACE. ONE DOES NOT EVEN HEAR RUMORS OF WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MIGHT CON- TAIN, ALTHOUGH ITS PROVISIONS, PARTICULARLY REGARDING SUCCESSION TO [[THE PRESIDENCY||6]], MIGHT BE ASSUMED OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST TO ALL [[POLITICALLY CONSCIOUS AFGHANS||7]].

3. [[THE COMMITTEE||3]] ITSELF HAS MET TWICE, ON MARCH 30 AND APRIL 22, TO DISCUSS [[ITS||3]] WORK. AT THE FIRST MEETING [[MINISTER OF [[JUSTICE||8]] ABDUL MAJID||9]] WAS UN- ANIMOUSLY ELECTED [[THE [[COMMISSION'S||3]] PRESIDENT||9]], AS MAY WELL HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BOTH FROM THE WEIGHT OF [[HIS||9]] OWN PRESTIGE AND FROM [[DAOUD'S||2]] ANNOUNCING FORMATION OF [[THE COMMISSION||3]] IN A LETTER TO [[ABDUL MAJID||9]], AS THOUGH TO SPOT [[HIM||9]] FOR THIS RESPONSIBILITY. AT THE SECOND MEETING [[OTHER OFFICERS||10]] WERE SELECTED: [[WAFIULLAH SAMAYEE||12]] BECAME [[SECRETARY TO [[THE COMMISSION||3]]||12]] AND [[ISMAIL QASEMYAR||13]] [[[[HIS||12]] ASSISTANT||13]]. ([[SAMAYEE||12]] IS [[SECOND DEPUTY MINISTER OF [[EDUCATION||14]]||12]] AND [[QASEMYAR||13]] AN [[OFFICIAL OF [[THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE||8]]||13]]. [[KABUL||1]] A-29 CONTAINS MORE COMPLETE BIO INFORMATION.)

4. EVEN NOW IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER [[[[COMMISSION||3]] MEMBERS||11]] HAVE BEEN GIVEN COPIES OF THE DOCUMENT [[THEY||11]] HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED TO STUDY. ([[WE||4]] ARE NOT IN FACT POSITIVE AN ACTUAL TEXT EXISTS.) AT THE FIRST MEETING [[ABDUL MAJID||9]] HELD UP A THICK DOCUMENT PURPORTED TO BE A DRAFT OF THE CONSTITUTION, BUT [[HE||9]] DID NOT OFFER A LOOK AT ITS CONTENTS OR A SUMMARY OF [[HIS||9]] OWN UNDER- STANDING OF IT. [[ABDUL MAJID||9]] INSTEAD REPORTEDLY GAVE A KIND OF PEP TALK ABOUT THE SERIOUS NATURE OF [[THE COMMISSION'S||3]] WORK, AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT HAD FALLEN ON [[[[ITS||3]] MEMBERS||11]]. [[MEMBERS OF [[THE COMMISSION||3]]||11]] THEN PROCEEDED TO DEBATE WHETHER [[EACH PERSON||11]] SHOULD STUDY THE CONSTITUTION IN ITS ENTIRETY OR DIVIDE THE DOCUMENT INTO COMPONENT PARTS FOR STUDY BY [[SUB-COMMITTEES||15]]. [[[[THE COMMISSION||3]] PRESIDENT||9]] TOOK THE DOCUMENT WITH [[HIM||9]] UPON DEPARTURE, AND ALTHOUGH LESS HAS BEEN LEARNED ABOUT THE [[COMMISSION'S||3]] SECOND MEETING [[WE||4]] HAVE YET TO HEAR THAT DRAFTS OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION EXIST IN NUMBER AND ARE FREELY AVAILABLE TO [[[[COMMISSION||3]] MEMBERS||11]].

5. OPINIONS [[WE||4]] HAVE HEARD OF [[[[THE COMMISSION'S||3]] MEMBERSHIP||11]] HAVE BEEN GENERALLY CYNICAL, A STATE OF MIND PROPAGANDA EMANATING FROM [[PAKISTAN||16]] WAS QUICK TO EXPLOIT. NOR HAS THIS CYNICISM BEEN CONFINED TO [[THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT||7]]. REPORTS ARE THAT [[PAK||16]] PROPAGANDA DERIDING [[THE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION||3]], WHICH WAS BOTH MORDANT AND AMUSING, BECAME OVERNIGHT A WIDELY QUOTED [[KABUL||1]] JOKE. OTHER REPORTS ARE THAT [[THE COMMISSION||3]] HAS BEEN WIDELY AND DERISIVELY DISCUSSED AT [[[[KABUL||1]] UNIVERSITY||17]]. [[MANY PEOPLE||18]] APPARENTLY VIEW [[THE COMMISSION||3]] AND [[ITS||3]] WORK AS A "FOOT DRAGGING EXERCISE".

6. ONE ESPECIALLY CYNICAL VIEW OF [[THE COMMISSION||3]] IS THAT [[DAOUD||2]] HAS DELIBERATELY SET UP [[A GROUP||11]] MOSTLY OF NON-[[MOHAMMADZAI||19]], NONENTITIES PRECISELY IN ORDER TO WATCH THE ENDEAVOR FAIL. CYNICS, AGAIN, HAVE IT THAT THIS WOULD PRESENT [[DAOUD||2]] WITH THE BEST OF OPPOSING WORLDS: [[HE||2]] WOULD HAVE "DELIVERED" ON [[HIS||2]] PROMISE OF A CONSTITUTION, BUT [[HE||2]] WOULD BE LEFT WITH NO DOCUMENT WHICH MIGHT TIE [[HIS||2]] HANDS OR ALTER [[HIS||2]] METHOD OF CONTROL. [[DAOUD||2]] AND [[[[HIS||2]][[MOHAMMADZAI||19]] RELATIVES||20]] WOULD AS WELL HAVE ESCAPED THE OPPROBRIUM OF FAILURE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ENDEAVOR. THIS VIEW HOWEVER SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT [[DAOUD||2]] EITHER PLANS TO LIVE FOREVER OR THAT [[HE||2]] IS OBLIVIOUS TO THE NEED TO PROVIDE A SUCCESSION. THIS APPEARS TO [[US||4]] A HARSH JUDGMENT UPON [[A MAN||2]] WHOSE PATRIOTISM IS UNDOUBTED AND WHOSE HARDREALISM ABOUT MOST THINGS MIGHT BE PRESUMED TO INCLUDE REALISM ABOUT [[HIS||2]] OWN MORTALITY.

7. MORE IMPORTANT HOWEVER THAN PREDICTABLE CARPING AND CHARACTER ASSASSINATION IS THE FACT THAT NO [[AFGHANS||18]] WITH WHOM [[WE||4]] ARE ACQUAINTED SEEM TO FIND THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION AN EVENT IN WHICH [[THEIR||18]] OWN POLITICAL VIEWS CAN BE OR EVEN OUGHT TO BE REGISTERED. IT IS BY CON- SENSUS A DICTATED DOCUMENT WHICH WILL BE PRO- MULGATED; IT IS NOT NOW A MATTER FOR DEBATE AND FOR THAT MATTER MAY OR MAY NOT EVER BECOME ONE. SPECULATION IS THAT [[DAOUD||2]] WILL SOMEHOW MANAGE TO RIG AN APPROVING [[“NATIONAL ASSEMBLY”||21]] ([[“LOYA JIRGAH”||21]]) JUST AS [[HE||2]] HAS RIGGED ALL THINGS HERETOFORE. (COMMENT: THIS TOO STRIKES [[US||4]] AS CYNICAL. LARGE [[AFGHAN||18]] GATHERINGS ARE VOLATILE. [[THE GREAT “LOYA JIRGAH”||21]] WHICH APPROVED THE 1964 CONSTITUTION WAS NOT A TAME BODY ASSEMBLED TO APPLY A RUBBER STAMP. NOR WAS THIS THE CASE OF [[THE "JIRGAH”||21]] [[DAOUD||2]] [[HIMSELF||2]] CALLED TOGETHER IN NOVEMBER OF 1955 TO APPROVE [[HIS||2]] HANDLING OF RELATIONS WITH [[PAKISTAN||22]] AND THE [[PUSHTUNISTAN||23]] ISSUE. TO BE SURE BOTH CASES DEMONSTRATE THE CLEAR ADVAN- TAGES THAT ACCRUE TO [[A WELL ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT||5]] RESPONSIBLE FOR DRAFTING, OVER A LARGE AND

8. POLITICAL RALK HOWEVER DOES NOT END IN [[KABUL||1]] MERELY BECAUSE POLITICS HAS ENTERED A NEW AND PUZZLING PHASE IN WHICH NO ONE QUITE KNOWS HOW TO ACT AND EVEN SPECULGMION IS STRAINED. PERHAPS FOR OTHER REASONS, PERHAPS PRECISELY BECAUSE "UNDERSTANDABLE" POLITICS HAVE BEEN DERAILED BY [[DAOUD'S||2]] UNWONTED DEMO- CRATIC GESTURE, RUMORS OF COUP HAVE COME TO [[US||4]] FROM [[SEVERAL SOURCES||31]]. LOGIC WOULD HAVE IT THAT [[ANYONE WHO MIGHT IN FACT SEEK TO TURN [[DAOUD||2]] OUT OF OFFICE||32]] SHOULD MOVE QUICLY -- OR, THAT IS, AT LEAST AHEAD OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS. WHILE IT OUGHT NOT TO BE ARGUED THAT LEGALITY WOULD WEIGH HEAVILY ON THE MINDS OF [[ANY PERSON WHO MIGHT SEEK [[DAOUD'S||2]] OVERTHROW||32]] NEITHER SHOULD IT BE DENIED THAT A SUCCESSFUL COUP AGAINST [[DAOUD'S||2]] ESSENTIALLY SELF-PROCLAIMED RULE WOULD FIND GREATER ACCEPTANCE INTERNATIONALLY NOW THAN WOULD BE THE CASE AFTER [[[[DAOUD'S||2]] REGIME||5]] HAS BEEN AFFIRMED BY SOME KIND OF PUBLIC EXPRES- SION. COUP RUMORS EMANATE FROM [[THE MOHAMMADZAI CLAN||19]] ITSLEF, FROM [[THE MILITARY||33]], AND FROM A MYSTERIOUS CABAL WHICH PRESENTS ITSELF AS NATIONALISTIC AND PROGRESSIVE. RUMORS OF A [[LEFTIST||34]] COUP HAVE APPEARED TO [[US||4]] IN THE GUISE OF NERVOUS INQUIRY ON THE PART OF [[RANKING MEMBERS OF [[“THE AFGHAN ESTABLISHMENT”||7]]||35]].

9. [[EMBASSY||4]] HAS COMMENTED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HOW VULNERABLE [[DAOUD||2]] IS TO AN ASSASSIN'S BULLET OR THE RAVAGES OF AGE AND ILLNESS. IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INTERESTING THAT JUST AS PRE- VALENT AS COUP RUMORS HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD CONCERN DURING THE PAST FEW MONTHS OVER [[DAOUD'S||2]] HEALTH. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THIS CONCERN HAS BEEN EXPRESSED PRIVATELY BY [[LEADERS OF [[NEIGHBORING NATIONS||36]]||37]]. AT ONE POINT THERE WAS EVEN THE BAZAAR RUMOR (AND ALSO THE BIZARRE RUMOR, SINCE IT WAS ALL ALONG DEMONSTRABLY UNTRUE) THAT [[DAOUD||2]] HAD DIED. YET IN THE CLOSED AND INTRICATE WORLD IN WHICH [[THE [[AFGHAN||5]] PRESIDENT||2]] LIVES, IN WHICH VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IS HELD SECRET, IT IS PERHAPS NOT SURPRISING THAT SUCH RUMORS SHOULD ABOUND. IT IS ONLY THEIR INTENSITY AND VOLUME THAT DEMONSTRATE [[KABUL'S||1]] CURRENT EDGINESS. [[WE||4]] FOR [[OUR||4]] PART BELIEVE [[DAOUD||2]] IS IN GOOD HEALTH.

10. ASIDE, HOWEVER, FROM THE EVER PRESENT POSSI- BILITY OF DISABLING ILLNESS OR ASSASSINATION, [[EMBASSY||4]] STANDS WITH [[ITS||4]] VIEW THAT [[DAOUD||2]] IS IN THOROUGH CONTROL OF [[AFGHANISTAN'S GOVERNMENT||5]] AND POLITICAL PROCESSES.
