1. THE ROUTINE REVIEW OF THE JUNE 4 ELECTION RESULTS (REF A) WHICH SHOWED [[LIBERAL CANDIDATE TURBAY|| 1]]  LEADING [[[[HIS || 1]] CONSERVATIVE OPPONENT || 2]] BY NEARLY 140,000 VOTES, IS BEING CARRIED OUT PEACE- FULLY AT THE VOTING DISTRICT LEVEL. THIS FIRST STAGE OF THE PRESCRIBED REVIEW IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED UNTIL JUNE 14 OR 15.


2. SO FAR, THE RESULTS IN SEVERAL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN CHAL- LENGED BY BOTH LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES, BUT NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE FINAL RESULT IS EXPECTED. HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS OF BOTH MAJOR PARTIES HAVE INDICATED PRIVATELY TO [[EMBASSY OFFICERS || 3]] THAT THEIR PARTY MEMBERS WILL HONOR THE DECISION OF THE ELECTORAL COURT WHICH WILL DECLARE THE VICTOR. [[TURBAY || 1]]  CON- TINUES TO MAKE CONCILIATORY STATEMENTS, IMPLYING THAT [[HE || 1]] WILL INVITE A SIZEABLE CONSERVATIVE PARTICIPATION-FROM BOTH OF THAT PARTY'S FACTIONS-IN [[HIS || 1]] GOVERNMENT. [[BETANCUR ||2 ]] , VACATION- ING IN [[CARTAGENA || 4]], HAS MADE NO OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS SINCE URGING [[HIS || 2]] SUPPORTERS TO FOLLOW THE ELECTION REVIEW CLOSELY (REF B). "COMMENT: THE TEMPERATE ATTITUDES OF THE TWO MAJOR CANDIDATES ARE REFLECTED IN THE CALMNESS WITH WHICH [[COLOMBIANS || 4]]  IN GENERAL ARE AWAITING THE COMPLETION OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS."
