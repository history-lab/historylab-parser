1. [[BELA BENYEI, [[HUNGARIAN||2]] AMBASSADOR TO [[LAOS||3]]||1]], TOLD [[US||4]] JANUARY 26 THAT THE RECENT VISIT OF AN [[[[HUNGARIAN||2]] AID TEAM||5]] HAD BEEN TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE AID PROJECTS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EXISTING [[LAO||3]]-[[HUNGARIAN||2]] AID AGREE- MENT. [[THE TEAM||5]] WAS HOPING TO RECEIVE PROPOSALS FROM [[THE LAO||3]] AS TO HOW [[HUNGARIAN||2]] AID MIGHT BE USED. AS USUAL, [[BENYEI||1]] SAID, THE DELAYS STEMMED FROM THE LACK OF ECONOMIC EXPERTISE AMONG [[THE LAO||3]] AND [[THEIR||3]] INABILITY TO BE PRECISE ABOUT [[THEIR||3]] NEEDS.

2. [[BENYEI||1]] TOLD [[US||4]] IN CONFIDENCE THAT THE [[HUNGARIAN||2]] TREND OF THINKING WAS THAT AID TO ESTABLISH A POULTRY FARM AND A [[LAO||6]] VETERINARY MEDICINE INDUSTRY MIGHT BE THE MOST SUITABLE TYPES OF PROJECTS.

3. [[BENYEI||1]] SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH NO SPECIFIC PROJECTS HAD BEEN AGREED UPON, [[HUNGARY||2]] HAD ALREADY PROVIDED [[LAOS||3]] WITH 27 TONS OF HUMAN AND VETERINARY MEDICINES. THEY HAD ARRIVED IN TWO CARGO PLANES CHARTERED FROM [[AUSTRIA||7]], ONE LAST MONTH AND ONE JUST LAST WEEK. A THIRD FLIGHT WITH 19 TONS OF MEDICINES AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WAS EXPECTED SOON.
