1. ON BASIS RECENT DISCUSSIONS HELD BY [[[[U.S. || 1]] DIRECTOR || 2]] INDIVIDUALLY WITH [[[[ADB || 3]] PRESIDENT TAROICHI YOSHIDA || 4]] AND [[DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AKIRA TSUSAKA || 5]] RE [[ADB ||3]] RELATIONS WITH [[SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM (SRV) || 6]], [[USADB || 7]] WANTS TO REITERATE POINT MADE IN REFTEL (A) THAT IT MIGHT BE SIX MONTHS (FROM END JANUARY) OR POSSIBLY LONGER BEFORE ANY WITHDRAWAL OF LOAN FUNDS WOULD TAKE PLACE. ALTHOUGH LIFTING OF SUSPENSION OF BANK OPERATIONS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR PRIOR TO ANNUAL MEETING, THERE IS NO INTENTION FOR ANY IMMEDIATE DIS- BURSEMENT OF FUNDS. (ONLY DISBURSEMENT CONTEMPLATED AT PRESENT RELATES TO PAYMENT DUE AN [[AUSTRALIAN || 8]] CONSULTANT FOR [[SAIGON || 9]] WATER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT, WHICH COULD BE AUTHORIZED WITHOUT LIFTING SUSPENSION.)


2. ALL NINE PREVIOUS [[ADB || 3]] LOAN PROJECTS WILL LIKELY REQUIRE SEPARATE MISSIONS TO BRING THEM BACK ON STREAM. (THREE OF THESE LOANS FOR PROJECTS APPROVED IN DECEMBER 1974 -- INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK, SECOND FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT AND [[TAN AN || 9]] INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT -- HAVE NOT YET BECOME EFFECTIVE.) AS INDICATED REFTEL (B), [[SRV ||6]] WANTS TO HAVE [[SAIGON || 9 ]] TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT SHIFTED TO [[HANOI || 9]]. HOWEVER, IN [[TSUSAKA'S ||5]] VIEW, IT SHOULD BE HANDLED AS NEW PROJECT. IN ANY EVENT, ACCORDING TO [[TSUSAKA ||5]], NO PROJECT MISSIONS ARE CONTEMPLATED PRIOR TO ANNUAL MEETING.
