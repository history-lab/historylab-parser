1. (C) [[[[EMBASSY || 1]] ([[ICA ||2 ]]) FSN EMPLOYEE JOHN DOOKLEY  || 3]] WAS PEACEFULLY DETAINED BY TWO OFFICERS FROM [[POLICE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION (CID) || 4]] AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 P.M. LOCAL TIME NOV 16. [[DOOKLEY || 3]], WHO WAS WORKING AT [[OUR  || 1]] LIBRARY AT TIME OF ARREST, JOINS OTHERS ARRESTED OVER PREVIOUS EIGHTEEN-HOUR PERIOD (REF A).


2. (U) LIBRARY IMMEDIATELY CLOSED BY [[CHARGE || 5]].


3. (C) THERE HAVE BEEN TWO INDICATIONS THAT [[DOOKLEY|| 3]] POSSIBLY IN TROUBLE. FIRST WAS SUGGESTION BY [[MINISTER SINON ||6]] (REF B) THAT LIBRARY HAD BEEN USED BY SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS TO PLAN ANTI-[[GOVERNMENT || 7]] DEMONSTRATIONS. [[DOOKLEY|| 3]] IS GENERALLY KNOWN TO BE [[LIBRARY SUPERVISOR || 3]]. SECOND WAS FACT THAT [[HE|| 3]] WAS BEATEN UP, [[HE|| 3]] [[HIMSELF||3]] REPORTED, BY GROUP OF [[SOLDIERS || 8]] FEW DAYS AFTER CHILDRENS' DEMONSTRATIONS. [[DOOKLEY|| 3]] CLAIMED [[SOLDIERS || 8]] HAD SAID NOTHING ABOUT WHAT [[HE|| 3]] WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE DONE WRONG. IRONICALLY, [[DOOKLEY|| 3]] WAS [[[[CID||4]] OFFICER ||3]] BEFORE JOINING [[EMBASSY STAFF ||1]] IN JULY, 1978. BASED ON WHAT [[WE ||1]] HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER, MANY OF ARRESTEES APPEAR TO BE EX-POLICEMEN. EX-POLICEMEN ARE, AFTER ALL, ONLY GROUP IN SEYCHELLES NOT CURRENTLY ON [[GOS||7]] PAYROLL WITH WEAPONS TRAINING. THUS, IT MAY BE THAT [[DOOKLEY'S || 3]] DETENTION IS PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AND NOT RELATED TO ANY SPECIFIC [[GOS||7]] EVIDENCE/CONCERN ABOUT ANTI-[[REGIME||7]] PLOTTING ON [[HIS||3]] PART. FOR RECORD, [[CHARGE||5]] ASKED [[DOOKLEY|| 3]] ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO AVOID IDENTIFICATION WITH POLITICAL OPPOSITION, BECAUSE THAT MIGHT COMPROMISE POSITION OF [[EMBASSY ||1]]. [[HE|| 3]] ALWAYS PROMISED TO HEED THAT ADVISE.


4. (C) [[WE||1]] ARE NOT SURE HOW TO PROCEED FROM THIS POINT. OBVIOUSLY, [[WE||1]] HAVE NO RIGHT OF CONSULAR ACCESS, BUT DO [[WE||1]] HAVE RIGHT/RESPONSIBILITY TO ASK [[POLICE|| 9]] OR [[FOREIGN MINISTRY|| 10]] FORMALLY FOR EXPLANATION OF [[DOOKLEY'S || 3]] ARREST? FYI, LOCAL CHAUFFEUR OF [[[[UK||11]] HIGH COMMISSION|| 12]] WAS AMONG THOSE DETAINED BY [[GOS|| 7]] IN APRIL AND RELEASED IN JULY, 1978. [[CHARGE ||5]] WILL CONSULT [[HIGH COMMISSION|| 12]] AS TO HOW THAT SITUATION WAS HANDLED.


5. (U) REQUEST GUIDANCE.


[[FELDER  || 5]]
