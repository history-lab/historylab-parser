1. (U) POLITICAL POT SIMMERING -- SINCE THE SETTLEMENT OF THE GENERAL STRIKE IN LATE AUGUST AND THE SUPPRESSION OF A PRISON MUTINY A FEW DAYS LATER, THE POLITICAL PACE HAS SLOWED -- ALMOST AS IF TO GIVE EVERYONE A CHANCE FOR A BREATHING SPELL. HOWEVER, ALL IS NOT TOTALLY QUIET. TAKING THEIR CUES FROM A SPEECH LAST WEEK BY [[EDUCATION MINISTER JAGATSINGH || 1]], A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS HAVE SPECULATED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE GENERAL STRIKE AND PRISON MUTINY WERE ELEMENTS IN AN ABORTED PLOT BY [[THE MMM|| 2]] TO MOUNT A COUP D'ETAT. SOME PAPERS HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST THAT [[THE PRIME MINISTER || 3]] RETURNED TO [[THE COUNTRY|| 4]] FROM [[EUROPE|| 5]] WITHOUT GOING TO THE [[HAVANA || 7]] [[NAM || 6]] SUMMIT BECAUSE [[HE|| 3]] LEARNED OF THE PLOT. [[THE MMM|| 2]] HAS DENIED HAVING HAD ANY SUCH PLANS. THIS WEEK [[FORMER [[LABOR PARTY || 8]]  DISSIDENT HARISH BOODHOO || 9]] AND [[HIS|| 9]] FOLLOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THE FORMATION OF A THIRD PARTY AT A SEPTEMBER 14 [[PORT LOUIS ||4 ]] RALLY.


(C) COMMENT: THE TALK ABOUT A PLANNED AUGUST COUP SEEMS TO BE NO MORE THAN [[LABOR PARTY|| 8]] PROPAGANDA AGAINST [[THE MMM|| 2]]. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF WHICH [[THE EMBASSY || 10]] IS AWARE TO SUPPORT THE CONTENTION THAT ANYONE HAD ANY PLANS TO OVERTHROW [[THE GOVERNMENT|| 11]]. [[BOODHOO || 9]], SINCE [[HIS || 9]] EXPULSION FROM [[THE LABOR PARTY || 8]] IN JULY, HAS BEEN HOLDING MEETINGS THROUGHOUT [[THE ISLAND|| 4]]. IT APPEARS THAT [[HE || 9]] MAY HAVE LOST SOME CREDIBILITY WITH THE PUBLIC IN [[HIS || 9]] WAFFLING APPROACH TO THE AUGUST GENERAL STRIKE. [[HE || 9]] GAVE EVERY INDICA- TION OF BEING UNABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO BACK [[THE GOVERNMENT || 11]] OR [[THE MMM || 2]].


2. (U) [[RAMGOOLAM|| 3]] DISAVOWS [[RAMPHUL|| 12]] -- WITHIN HOURS OF RECEIPT [[HERE || 4]] OF NEWS AGENCY DISPATCHES REPORTING THE SPEECH OF 
[[[[MAURITIUS || 4 ]] UN [[PERMREP RAMPHUL || 12]] || 13]]  IN [[HAVANA|| 14]] WHERE [[HE || 12]]  REPRESENTED [[THE PRIME MINISTER|| 3]], SOME OF [[RAMPHUL'S || 12]] COMMENTS WERE PUBLICLY DISAVOWED BY [[PRIME MINISTER RAMGOOLAM || 3]]. [[RAMPHUL'S || 12]] SPEECH APPARENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED SOVEREIGNTY OVER [[THE ISLAND OF MAYOTTE|| 15]] BY [[THE COMOROS|| 16]] AND ANNOUNCED SUPPORT FOR THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF [[[[FRENCH|| 17]] OVERSEAS TERRITORIES|| 18]]. IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED ON SEPT 10, [[THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE || 3]] SPECIFICALLY DISAVOWED THESE COMMENTS OF [[RAMPHUL'S || 12]]. THE PRESS HAS APPARENTLY CORRECTLY LINKED THE DISAVOWAL WITH THE FACT THAT THIS YEAR'S MEETING OF [[THE [[FRENCH || 17]]- [[MAURITIAN || 4]] MIXED COMMISSION|| 19]] WAS BEING HELD IN [[PARIS|| 17]] THIS WEEK.
