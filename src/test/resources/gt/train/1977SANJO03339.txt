1. [[TEOFILO DE LA TORRE|| 1]], [[ENGINEER IN CHARGE OF [[COSTA RICAN|| 2]] GEOTHERMAL PROGRAM|| 1]], CALLED [[EMBOFF|| 3]] JULY 18 TO ADVISE THAT [[ICE PERSONNEL|| 4]] ARE EXPECTING A VERY HEAVY WORKLOAD TOWARD END OF THIS YEAR AND THAT A GEOTHERMAL ENERGY PROGRAM WILL BE HELD BY [[[[JAPANESE || 6]] INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER || 5]] IN [[SAN JOSE || 2]] OCTOBER 17-19. IN VIEW OF THE WORKLOAD AND THE PROXIMITY OF [[JAPANESE  || 6]] PROGRAM, [[HE  || 1]] WONDERED IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HOLD THE [[U.S. || 7]] SALES SEMINAR IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY 1978, INSTEAD OF NOVEMBER 2-7, 1977 AS NOW SCHEDULED.


2. [[EMBOFF || 3]] POINTED OUT THAT THE PLANNING FOR [[U.S. || 7]] SEMINAR WAS WELL ADVANCED AND INCLUDED PROGRAMS IN [[MEXICO || 8]] AND [[GUATEMALA || 9]] AS WELL AS [[SAN JOSE || 2]]. IT WOULD THERE- FORE APPEAR VERY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE DATES AT THIS STAGE. [[DE LA TORRE || 1]] AGREED THAT IF SEMINAR HELD IN NOVEMBER [[ICE || 4]] WOULD STILL BE WILLING TO ACT AS CO-SPONSOR INSOFAR AS ISSUING INVITATIONS TO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES BUT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT.


3. JULY 19 [[EMBOFF || 3]] DISCUSSED MATTER OF [[ICE || 4]] SUPPORT FOR SEMINAR WITH [[EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT ALEX MEERRY || 10]], WHO CON- FIRMED THAT WHILE [[ICE || 4]] COULD NOT PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT, [[IT || 4]] WOULD BE WILLING TO INVITE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO PARTICIPATE AND TO PROVIDE A SUITABLE MEETING ROOM IN THE [[ICE || 4]] BUILDING FOR THE SEMINAR.


4. PROVIDED FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO COVER ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT COSTS (SIMULTANEOUS TRANSLATION, PROGRAM PREPARA- TION, REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, ETC.) WHICH [[ICE || 4]] ORIGINALLY WAS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE, [[EMBASSY || 11]] CONTINUES TO FAVOR HOLDING SEMINAR AS PLANNED IN [[SAN JOSE || 10]]. HOWEVER, [[WE  || 11]] WOULD APPRECIATE COMMENTS FROM [[STATE || 12]], [[COMMERCE || 13]] AND OTHER POSTS.
