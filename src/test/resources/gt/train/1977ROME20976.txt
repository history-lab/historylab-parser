1. SUMMARY. [[ITALY'S ||1]] TRAINS BEGAN TO GET BACK ON SCHEDULE DECEMBER 21. A QUICK JANUARY ADVANCE ON AN EVENTUAL RETROACTIVE SETTLEMENT INDUCED [[THE INDEPENDENT RAIL UNION FISAFS || 2]] TO SUSPEND THE SERIES OF SHORT STRIKES WHICH HAVE SNARLED  [[ITALY'S ||1]] HOLIDAY RAIL TRAFFIC. [[[[CCU || 3]] UNIONS || 12]], EXCEPT RAIL UNIONS, HELD A ONE-HOUR GENERAL STRIKE DECEMBER 20 IN SUPPORT OF POLICE UNIONIZATION? END SUMMARY.


2. ON DECEMBER 21, [[THE INDEPENDENT ("AUTONOMOUS") RAILROAD WORKERS' UNION FISAFS || 2]] ENDED [[ITS||2]] SERIES OF ONE-HOUR AND THREE- HOUR STRIKES WHICH HAVE SNARLED [[ITALY'S ||1]]  HOLIDAY RAIL TRAFFIC. [[FISAFS|| 2]] SUSPENDED [[ITS|| 2]] STRIKES IN RESPONSE TO AN 80,000 LIRE ADVANCE TO BE GIVEN RAILWAY EMPLOYEES IN JANUARY IN ANTICIPATION OF AN EVENTUAL RETROACTIVE RAISE TO BRING THE LOW PAY OF [[ITALY'S ||1]] RAILWAY WORKERS MORE IN LINE WITH THE HIGHER PAY OF MUNICIPAL TRANSIT AND OTHER TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WORKERS. [[TRANSPORT MINISTER LATTANZIO  || 4]] FIRST AGREED ON THIS SETTLEMENT WITH [[THE [[CGIL || 6]], [[CISL || 7]] AND [[UIL || 8]] RAILROAD UNIONS ||5 ]]. [[HIS||4]] UNDERSECRETARY THEN MET WITH [[FISAFS|| 2]] TO INFORM [[THEM|| 2]] AND TO ASSURE [[THEM|| 2]] OF PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF NEGOTIATIONS ON SALARY ADJUSTMENT AND OTHER ISSUES (PARTICULARLY MORE AUTONOMOUS STATUS FOR [[THE STATE RAILROAD || 9]], INCLUDING AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITHOUT [[PARLIAMENTARY || 10]] APPROVAL.) [[FISAFS|| 2]] DID NOT ACHIEVE [[ITS|| 2]]  GOAL OF RECOGNITION ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH [[THE THREE CCU RAIL UNIONS ||5]], BUT DID ENHANCE [[ITS|| 2]]  STATUS AND TREATMENT SOMEWHAT. [[FISAFS|| 2]]  RESERVED THE OPTION OF REOPENING [[ITS|| 2]]  STRIKE IF IMPLEMENTATION AND FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS PROVE DISAPPOINTING.


3. COMMENT. [[FISAFS|| 2]] IS THE MOST MILITANT AND EFFECTIVE OF THE AUTONOMOUS UNIONS, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF [[THE AIRLINE PILOTS' UNION (ANPAC) ||11]]. [[FISAFS|| 2]]  IS GROWING IN MEMBERSHIP AND PRESTIGE IN RELATION TO [[THE CCU UNIONS || 12]] , AND ENJOYS INCREASING RESPECT AND POPULARITY AMONG THE OTHER "AUTONOMOUS" UNIONS. ABOUT HALF OF THE AUTONOMOUS UNIONS BELONG TO [[THE CONFERERATION CISAL || 7]], WHICH RECENTLY HELD ITS CONGRESS IN [[ROME ||1]]. [[[[FISAFS|| 2]]  PRESIDENT PIETRANGELI || 13]], A GUEST ALONG WITH LEADERS OF OTHER NON-AFFILIATED, AUTONOMOUS UNIONS WAS THE MOST APPLAUDED FIGURE. [[CISAL || 7]] AND THE OTHER AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATIONS LAID PLANS TO' TRY TO CONSOLIDATE THEMSELVES NEXT JUNE INTO ONE BIG CONFEDERATION IN COMPETITION WITH [[CGIL || 6]], [[CISL || 7]] AND [[UIL || 8]]. END COMMENT.


4. [[CCU UNIONS ||12]] HELD A ONE-HOUR NATIONWIDE GENERAL STRIKE 10-11 AM DECEMBER 20 IN SUPPORT OF [[ POLICE || 17]] REFORM LEGISLATION TO DEMILITARIZE POLICEMENT AND ALLOW [[THEM || 17]] TO JOIN UNIONS OF [[THEIR ||17]] CHOICE. ORGANIZERS OF THE [[POLICE||17]] UNION-IN-FORMATION (REFTEL) SPOKE TO WORKER ASSEMBLIES AT MAJOR FACTORIES EXPLAINING THEIR AIMS. [[THE CCU RAIL UNIONS || 18]] DID NOT STRIKE, IN ORDER TO AVOID GIVING ANY HELP TO THE [[FISAFS|| 2]] STRIKE. MUNICIPAL TRANSIT WORKERS STOPPED TRAFFIC ONLY 15 MINUTES, BUT MOST TRAFFIC AT [[[[ROME'S || 1]] FIUMICINO AIRPORT || 14]] WAS BLOCKED FOR TWO HOURS. [[THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY ||15]], WHICH OPPOSES FREEDOM FOR [[THE POLICE||17]] TO ORGANIZE A UNION AFFILIATED TO [[CCU || 3]] AND WANTS TO DEMILITARIZE ONLY THE LESS VITAL POLICE ELEMENTS, SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE [[CCU || 3]] STRIKE FOR EXERCISING WHAT IT TERMED ILLICIT PRESSURE ON [[PARLIAMENT ||10]] AND TRYING TO UNDERMINE [[PARLIAMENTARY ||10]] SOVEREIGNTY IN A VERY DELICATE AREA.
