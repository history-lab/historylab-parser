1. IN ABSENCE OF [[STATE SECRETARY FRANK || 1]] AND [[POLITICAL DIRECTOR VAN WELL || 2]], [[DCM || 3]] CALLED ON [[ ASSISTANT SECRETARY HERMES||4]] TO EXPLAIN APPROACHES [[WE || 5]] HAVE IN MIND WITH RESPECT TO INCREASED BURDEN- SHARING EFFORTS. 


[[HERMES | 4]], WHO HAD IN [[HIS COMPANY||4]]  FIVE OTHER OFFICIALS WITH RESPON- SIBILITIES IN [[NATO||6]] AND BOP PROBLEMS, ASKED SEVERAL EX- PLORATORY QUESTIONS AND THEN MADE REMARKS IN PARA 2 WHICH [[HE ||4]] DESCRIBED AS PRELIMINARY AND TENTATIVE [[FRG || 7]] REACTION. [[HE ||4]] SAID [[HE ||4]] WOULD BE IN TOUCH WITH [[US||5]] LATER PART OF NEXT WEEK WITH MORE DEFINITIVE VIEWS.
2. [[HERMES | 4]] SAID [[FRG || 7]] UNDERSTOOD AND SYMPATHIZED WITH ANY [[US||5]] BURDEN- SHARING INITIATIVE WHICH WOULD REDUCE [[CONGRES- SIONAL || 8]] PRESSURES TO CUT [[US||5]] TROOP LEVELS IN [[EUROPE||9]]. AS SUCH, [[HE ||4]] GAVE IMPRESSION THAT [[FRG || 7]] WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO OPPOSE BURDEN- SHARING EFFORT, ALTHOUGH [[HE ||4]] POINTED OUT THAT MULTILATERALIZATION PROPOSALS CAN REACT TO [[FRG’S || 7]] DISADVANTAGE. [[HE ||4]] ALSO NOTED THAT A PREVIOUS MULTILATERAL OFFSET PROPOSAL IN EARLY 1960' S WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. [[HERMES | 4]] BRIEFLY REVIEWED SITUATION IN SEVERAL [[NATO||6]] COUN- TRIES, PARTICULARLY [[NORWAY || 10]], [[DENMARK || 11]], [[BELGIUM || 12]], AND [[THE NETHERLANDS || 13]], AND DOUBTED THEY WOULD DO MUCH TO HELP ON BOP PROBLEMS, GIVEN FACT THAT [[[[US||5]] TROOPS || 14]] WERE NOT STA- TIONED THERE. ALL OF THIS ADDED UP TO A DISTINCT LACK OF OPTIMISM ON [[HERMES’ | 4]] PART THAT [[OUR || 5]] INITIATIVE IN [[DPC || 15]] WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION, CONCERN WAS EXPRESSED BY [[HERMES’ | 4]] COLLEAGUES OVER COMPLICATIONS FOR OFFSET NEGOTIATIONS [[US||5]] INITIATIVE WOULD HAVE.


[[HILLENBRAND || 16]]
