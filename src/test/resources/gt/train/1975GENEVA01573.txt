THE TOURISM PAPER, NOW SPLIT-OFF FROM THE TOURISM-YOUTH PAPER (REFTEL B), HAS MOVED RAPIDLY IN INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS. [[SOVIETS ||1]] ARE REPORTED TO FIND THE CURRENT TEXT ACCEPTABLE EXCEPT FOR THE FINAL PARA. [[WE || 2]] BELIEVE THAT IT POSES NO REPEAT NO PROBLEMS FOR [[THE US || 3]]  AND HAVE PERMITTED IT TO MOVE FORWARD IN INFORMAL CHANNELS. BEING RELATIVELY NON-CONTROVERSIAL, IT IS LIKELY TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE EASTER RECESS. IF [[DEPARTMENT || 4]]  HAS OBJECTIONS PLEASE ADVISE. TEXT FOLLOWS:


BEGIN TEXT: "THE PARTICIPATING STATES CONSIDER THAT TOURISM CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEIR PEOPLES, TO A FULLER KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIFE, CULTURE, AND HISTORY OF OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL AS TO THE DEVELOP- MENT OF HUMAN CONTACTS.


THE PARTICIPATING STATES INTEND TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOURISM ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE BASIS.


IN PARTICULAR THEY EXPRESS THEIR INTENTION:
- TO PROMOTE VISITS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES BY ENCOURAGING THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FACILITIES, THE SIMPLIFICATION AND EXPEDITING OF NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING TRAVEL FORMALITIES, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTACTS;
- TO ALLOW PUBLICITY FOR TOURIST TRAVEL IN OTHER PARTICIPATING STATES, IN PARTICULAR BY FACILI- TATING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INFORMATION BUREAUX AND THE DISSEMINATION OF TOURIST INFORMATION."


END TEXT.
