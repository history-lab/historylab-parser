SUMMARY: [[FONMIN KAMEL ||1]] INFORMS THAT [[HE  ||1]] MET WITH [[VP MUBARAK || 2]] AND [[PRIMIN ||3]] THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS POINTS [[I || 4]] HAD MADE TO [[SADAT ||5]] YESTERDAY AND [[THE PRESIDENT'S || 5]] RESULTANT INSTRUC- TIONS. SINCE [[KAMEL ||1]]  REMAINED PUZZLED AS TO EXACTLY WHAT WAS WANTED,  [[I || 4]] REHEARSED [[MY || 4]]  PRESENTATION TO [[SADAT ||5]] FOR [[HIS||1]]  BENEFIT. [[KAMEL ||1]] IS DRAGGING [[HIS||1]] FEET ON REVISING [[EGYPTIAN || 6]] COUNTERPROPOSAL, ARGUING [[GOE|| 6]] NOT IN A POSITION TO DO SO WITHOUT [[JORDANIAN || 7]] AND [[PALESTINIAN || 8]] CONCURRENCE. [[HE||1]]  NEVER- THELESS AGREED LOOK AT IT AGAIN. [[MUBARAK || 2]] LEAVING FOR [[RIYADH ||9]], MAY 14, AND THEREAFTER FOR [[AMMAN ||10]] FOR CONSULTATIONS. [[KAMEL ||1]] SAID [[HE||1]]  HOPES SOME ANSWERS WILL BE READY PRIOR [[MY || 4]] DEPARTURE NEXT WEEK. END SUMMARY.


1. IN COURSE OF MEETING WITH [[FONMIN KAMEL ||1]] (AND [[AHMED MAHER | 11]] ) TODAY ON OTHER MATTERS (SEPTELS), [[KAMEL ||1]] SAID [[HE ||1]] HAD SPENT ALL MORNING IN A MEETING WITH [[ VP MUBARAK || 2]] AND [[PRIMIN SALEM || 3]]. [[MUBARAK || 2]] HAD CONVENED MEETING ON BASIS OF [[MY || 4]]  TALK YESTERDAY WITH [[SADAT ||5]] AND [[THE PRESIDENT'S ||5]] RESULTANT INSTRUCTIONS TO THEM. [[KAMEL ||1]] SEEMED GENUINELY PUZZLED AS TO WHAT WAS WANTED.  [[I || 4]] , THEREFORE, REVIEWED FOR [[KAMEL ||1]] SUBSTANCE REF B, INCLUDING [[OUR || 14]] TWO QUESTIONS TO [[THE ISRAELIS ||13]], THE FOUR QUESTIONS THAT [[THE ISRAELIS ||13]] WANT ANSWERED AND [[OUR|| 14]] POSITION THAT [[WE ||14]] REQUIRE INDICATION OF WILLINGNESS TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO [[OUR|| 14]] QUESTIONS BEFORE [[WE|| 14]]  CAN FORMALLY APPROACH [[SADAT ||5]] ON [[THE ISRAELI ||13]] QUESTIONS.  [[I || 4]]  ALSO RECALLED THAT [[SADAT ||5]] HAD THEREUPON INSTRUCTED [[MUBARAK || 2]] TO CONVENE MEETING OF  [[PRIMIN ||3]]  AND [[KAMEL ||1]] IN ORDER TO DRAW UP CERTAIN QUESTIONS WHICH MIGHT BE ASKED IF [[ ISRAELIS ||13]] GIVE [[US|| 14]] POSITIVE REPLY.


2. SOMEHOW THIS HAD NOT QUITE GOTTEN THROUGH FROM [[MUBARAK’S || 2]] BRIEFING. [[KAMEL ||1]] WAS AWARE THAT [[I || 4]] WILL BE RETURNING ON CONSULTATIONS THURSDAY, MAY 18, AND THAT [[SADAT ||5]] WANTS ANSWERS GIVEN TO [[ME|| 4]]  SO  [[I || 4]]  CAN TAKE THEM BACK. [[KAMEL ||1]] WAS UNCERTAIN EXACTLY WHAT WAS WANTED.  [[I || 4]]  TOLD [[HIM ||1]] THAT THIS CLEARLY SHOULD BE CHECKED WITH THE [[PRESIDENT || 5]], BUT [[MY || 4]]  IMPRESSION WAS THREE-FOLD: (A) QUES- TIONS THAT [[SADAT ||5]] MIGHT WISH TO RAISE IF [[ ISRAELI ||13]] ANSWERS ARE POSITIVE, (B) ANY PRELIMINARY COMMENTS [[SADAT ||5]] MIGHT HAVE ON THE FOUR  [[ ISRAELI ||13]]  QUESTIONS, AND (C) HOPEFULLY, A REVISED [[EGYPTIAN || 6]] COUNTERPROPOSAL FOR [[WEST BANK || 15]]/[[GAZA ||16]].


3. RE LATTER, [[KAMEL ||1]] DEMURRED. NOTING [[OUR || 14]] DESCRIPTION OF [[EGYPTIAN ||6]] COUNTERPROPOSAL AS LEGAL DOCUMENT, [[HE||1]] CONTENDED THAT [[BEGIN ||17]] PLAN IS EVEN MORE SO.  [[I || 4]] POINTED OUT THAT [[BEGIN ||17]] PLAN AT LEAST GIVES SOME INDICATION OF HOW SELF- RULE REGIME WILL WORK DURING TRANSITIONAL PERIOD;  [[EGYPTIAN || 6]] COUNTERPROPOSAL, WHILE REVISED FORM IS IMPROVEMENT OVER INITIAL DRAFT, DOES NO SUCH THING. HENCE, IT IS NOT VERY HELPFUL FOR PURPOSES [[WE ||14]] HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. WHAT  [[I || 4]]  HAD PROPOSED TO [[SADAT ||5]] IS THAT SOME OF THE POINTS [[THE PRESIDENT ||5]] HAS MADE PUBLICLY BE INCLUDED SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A NEGOTIATING DOCUMENT. [[KAMEL ||1]] WAS SKEPTICAL THAT [[GOE|| 6]] CAN DO SO WITHOUT CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR [[ITSELF ||6 ]] WITH OTHER [[ARABS ||18]]. [[MAHER || 11]] CHIMED IN TO ARGUE IT IS ONE THING FOR [[SADAT ||5]] TO EXPRESS [[HIS || 11]] PERSONAL IDEAS ON  [[WEST BANK || 15]]/[[GAZA ||16]] ARRANGEMENTS IN SPEECHES OR ARTICLES, BUT IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING FOR  [[GOE|| 6]]  TO MAKE A FORMAL PROPOSAL TO  [[THE ISRAELIS ||13]] , INCORPORATING SUCH IDEAS. THIS COULD ONLY BE DONE AFTER CONSULTATION WITH [[THE JORDANIANS ||7]] AND [[THE PALESTINIANS ||8]]. [[KAMEL ||1]] THOUGHT REVISED [[EGYPTIAN||6]] COUNTER- PROPOSAL IS ADEQUATE AS IT STANDS, BUT ON [[MY || 4]]  PERSISTENT URGING, AGREED TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT.


4. ASKED ABOUT CONSULTATIONS WITH [[HUSSEIN ||20]] AND [[SAUDIS ||19]], [[KAMEL ||1]] SAID [[VP MUBARAK || 2]] WILL GO TO [[RIYADH ||9]] SUNDAY, MAY 14, AND THEREAFTER TO [[AMMAN ||10]] TO CONSULT WITH  [[HUSSEIN ||20]]. SCENARIO WOULD BE GENERAL ONE [[SADAT ||5]] HAD DESCRIBED TO [[ME||4]]. [[HE || 1]] THOUGHT [[MUBARAK || 2]] WILL RETURN MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY. HENCE, [[EGYPTIAN || 6]] RESPONSES SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH [[HUSSEIN ||20]] AND [[SAUDIS || 19]].


5. [[WE ||23]] AGREED TO KEEP IN TOUCH


6. [[DEPT || 21]] MAY WISH REPEAT THIS MESSAGE TO [[TEL AVIV ||22]].
