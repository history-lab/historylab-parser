1. [[DEPARTMENT|| 1]] RECOGNIZES RISKS INVOLVED IN TAKING PART 213 ACTION AT THIS TIME. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, TWO FACTORS WHICH PERSUADE [[US|| 1]] THAT SOME MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN SCENARIO. FIRST, IT APPEARS TO [[US|| 1]]  THAT [[PERU ||2]] IS LOSING VERY LITTLE BY PERPETUATING CURRENT SITUATION IN WHICH [[BRANIFF ||3]] IS SEVERELY RESTRICTED AND LOSING MONEY WHILE [[AEROPERU ||4]] CONTINUES OPERATE UNRESTRICTED. [[AEROPERU || 4]] SEEMS TO HAVE CONVINCED [[ITSELF ||4]] THAT SHOW CAUSE ORDER POSES NO IMME- DIATE THREAT AND THAT [[CAB ||5]] PROCEEDING CAN BE TIED UP FOR MONTHS BY LEGAL MANEUVERING. (IN THIS CONNECTION, [[[[AEROPERU ||4]] COUNSEL || 8]] HAS JUST ASKED [[CAB ||5]]  FOR 30-DAY EXTENSION BEYOND MARCH 17 TO FILE [[ITS ||8]] RESPONSE.) SECONDLY, [[BRANIFF ||3 ]] INFORMS [[US|| 1]] THAT, UNLESS AN AGREEMENT CAN BE REACHED SOON, [[IT ||3]] MAY HAVE TO MAKE MAJOR REDUCTIONS IN [[ITS ||3]] [[PERU || 2]] SCHEDULES IN ORDER TRY TO CUT [[ITS ||3]] LOSSES. SUCH REDUCTIONS WOULD FAVOR [[AEROPERU ||4]] AND WOULD LIKELY BE VIEWED BY [[PERU || 2]] AS A VICTORY, MAKING IT ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN A SATISFACTORY AGREEMENT. IDEALLY, [[BRANIFF ||3 ]] WANTS TO IMPLEMENT TERMS OF HOPED-FOR AGREEMENT BY JUNE 1. BECAUSE OF LEAD TIME REQUIRED TO ARRANGE AND PUBLISH SCHEDULES, THIS MEANS AGREEMENT SHOULD BE REACHED BY END MARCH. WHILE [[WE || 1]] DOUBT AGREEMENT COULD BE REACHED BY THIS TIME UNDER BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, [[WE || 1]] ARE SYMPATHETIC WITH [[BRANIFF’S ||3 ]] DILEMMA.


2. [[DEPARTMENT|| 1]] HAS CONSULTED [[CAB ||5]] RE PART 213 TIMING. [[CAB ||5]] RELUCTANT TO DEFER A PART 213 ORDER BEYOND PERHAPS EARLY NEXT WEEK. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, [[DEPARTMENT|| 1]] BELIEVES [[ EMBASSY || 7]] SHOULD PROCEED PROMPTLY TO TAKE ACTION IN PARAS 4 AND 5 BELOW WHICH INVOLVES DELIVERY OF A [[US || 9]] PAPER AND A WARNING THAT RESTRICTIONS ON [[AEROPERU ||4]] FREQUENCIES MAY BE IMPOSED.


3.  [[ EMBASSY || 7]] SHOULD BE AWARE THAT [[PRESIDENT || 10]] HAS SEVERAL OPTIONS RE PART 213 ORDER. IF [[HE || 10]] TAKES NO ACTION, ORDER WOULD BE ISSUED AND MADE PUBLIC TEN DAYS AFTER SUBMISSION TO [[PRESIDENT || 10]] AND FLIGHT REDUCTIONS REQUIRED 30 DAYS THERE- AFTER. SECOND OPTION IS TO DISAPPROVE ORDER. THIRD OPTION IS TO STAY THE ORDER FOR EITHER AN INDEFINITE OR FIXED PERIOD, THAT IS, NEITHER APPROVING NOR DISAPPROVING BUT RESERVING [[HIS || 10]] PREROGATIVE TO TAKE ACTION LATER. LATTER OPTION MAY HAVE SOME LEVERAGE ADVANTAGE, SINCE IT GIVES A CLEAR SIGNAL TO [[PERU ||2]] OF WHAT LIKELY HAPPEN IF NEGOTIATIONS FAIL. IN ADDITION THESE OPTIONS, [[WE || 1]] COULD PROBABLY PREVAIL ON [[CAB ||5]] TO WITHDRAW ORDER RATHER THAN FACE [[PRESIDENTIAL ||10]] DISAPPROVAL IF [[WE || 1]] DECIDED AT THE TIME THAT NO PART 213 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN OR MADE PUBLIC.


4. TEXT OF PAPER PREPARED BY [[DEPARTMENT ||1]] IN RESPONSE PAPER PRESENTED BY [[[[PERU ||8]] [[ EMBASSY || 7]] BEING SENT SEPTEL. [[DEPT ||1]] RECOMMENDS PAPER BE DELIVERED TO [[GOP || 8]] AT HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE. IN DELIVERING PAPER, SUGGEST FOLLOWING ORAL POINTS BE MADE:
A. [[USG || 11]] DESIRES REACH A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION.
B. [[US || 9]] PAPER DEALS WITH THOSE ASPECTS OF [[PERU ||2]] PAPER WITH WHICH [[US || 11]] HAS DIFFICULTIES OR WITH RESPECT TO WHICH MEANING OF [[PERU ||2]] PAPER IS UNCLEAR. WHILE IT CAN BE ASSUMED [[US || 11]] HAS NO MAJOR DIFFICULTY WITH THOSE PARTS OF [[PERU ||2]] PAPER WHICH ARE NOT ADDRESSED IN [[US || 9]] PAPER, [[WE ||1]] OF COURSE MUST RESERVE [[OUR||1]] VIEWS ON THESE PARTS UNTIL RESPONSE RECEIVED TO [[US || 9]] PAPER.
C. IF RESPONSE TO [[US || 9]] PAPER INDICATES [[PERU ||8]] WILLINGNESS TO ATTEMPT ACCOMMODATE [[US || 11]] CONCERNS, IT WILL THEN PROBABLY BE NECESSARY TO BEGIN DETAILED NEGOTIATIONS. FYI. WHILE [[DEPARTMENT ||1]] NOT OPPOSED TO FURTHER AIRLINE TALKS IN THIS CONNECTION, [[WE ||1]] WONDER IF  [[WE ||1]] WOULD NOT BE BETTER OFF IF DETAILED NEGOTIATIONS WERE WITH [[FONOFF|| 12]]. END FYI.


5. IN ADDITION TO FOREGOING, [[AMBASSADOR ||13]] SHOULD ADVISE SENIOR [[GOP|| 8]]  LEVELS THAT [[USG || 11]] CANNOT ALLOW CURRENT UNSATIS- FACTORY SITUATION (IN WHICH [[BRANIFF ||3 ]] LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS, WHILE [[AEROPERU ||4]] CONTINUES OPERATE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS) TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY. ADMINISTRATIVE STEPS ARE UNDER WAY WHICH LIKELY RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON [[AEROPERU ||4]] FREQUENCIES UNLESS PROMPT PROGRESS MADE IN NEGOTIATING A SOLUTION. THESE RESTRICTIONS WOULD BE QUITE SEPARATE FROM FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WHETHER [[AEROPERU’S ||4]] PERMIT SHOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT. THEREFORE, [[US || 11]] LOOKS FOR A [[PERU || 8]] RESPONSE TO THE [[US || 9]] PAPER WITHIN ONE WEEK.
