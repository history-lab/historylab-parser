1. [[[[MFA [[AFRICAN || 1]] BUREAU DIRECTOR JAN AF SILLEN || 4]] || 2]]  PHONED [[FRG POL- ITICAL COUNSELOR ||3 ]] (FEBRUARY 6) RAISING SEVERAL SUBSTANTIVE QUES- TIONS REGARDING PROPOSED DRAFT AGREEMENT. REPRESENTATIVES OF [[ALL FIVE EMBASSIES || 24]], AFTER CONSULTING AMONG [[THEMSELVES ||24]], DECIDED TO CALL ON [[SILLEN || 2]] IN ATTEMPT TO FIELD [[MFA || 4]] QUESTIONS, ALLAY SOME CONCERNS, AND GET A FEEL FOR [[GOS || 5]] POSITION AT THIS POINT.


2. [[SILLEN ||2]] STRESSED THAT, IF [[NORDICS ||6]] WERE TO AGREE TO APPROACH [[SWAPO ||7]], [[THEY||6]] MUST BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS [[SWAPO ||7]] MIGHT RAISE RE [[THE WESTERN FIVE ||24]] PROPOSALS. INITIAL [[GOS || 5]] QUESTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
(A) [[[[UN || 9]] TROOPS || 10]]: THE AGREEMENT FIXES A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF [[[[SOUTH AFRICAN || 12]] TROOPS || 11]] (1500) ALTHOUGH [[SWAPO ||7]] HAS ALREADY STATED [[IT ||7]] COULD NOT ACCEPT ANY [[[[SOUTH AFRICAN || 12]] TROOPS || 11]] WHATEVER. [[HIS|| 2]] CONCERN COULD BE ALLAYED, [[SWEDES ||5]] BELIEVE, BY ASSURING [[SWAPO ||7]] OF ADEQUATE NUMBER OF OFFSETTING [[[[UN || 9]] TROOPS || 10]]. [[SWEDES ||5]]  WONDER HOW MUCH THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO NUMBER OF [[[[UN || 9]] TROOPS || 10]] TO BE POSTED? [[SWEDES ||5]]  HAVE [[THEIR ||5]] OWN INTEREST IN THIS QUESTION AS WELL SINCE [[[[SWEDISH || 5]] TROOPS || 8]] LIKELY TO BE A COMPONENT IN ANY EMERGING [[[[UN || 9]] TROOPS || 10]].
(B) POLICE: WOULD [[SWAPO ||7]] NOT BE FEARFUL OF RELYING ON [[[[SOUTH AFRICAN || 12]] POLICE || 13]] FOR MAINTENCE LAW AND ORDER?
(C) SURRENDER OF ARMS: IF [[WHITES ||25]] STILL PERMITTED TO BE PERSON- ALLY ARMED, WILL THAT NOT CREATE UNACCEPTABLE PROBLEM FOR [[SWAPO ||7]]?


3. [[EMBASSY REPS || 20]] FIELDED [[SWEDISH||5]] QUESTIONS NOTING THAT [[[[UN || 9]] SECGEN || 14]] TO KEEP IN MIND OPERATIONAL AND LOGISTICAL REQUIRE- MENTS IN DETERMINING NUMBER OF [[[[UN || 9]] TROOPS || 10]]; [[UNSR || 15]] TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR [[POLICE||13]] CONDUCT; AND PURPOSE OF SURRENDER OF ARMS CLAUSE IS TO PREVENT [[WHITES ||25]]  FROM ORGANIZING SUPPLEMENTARY FORCE BEYOND THE 1500 LIMIT. [[WE|| 20]] STRESSED, FOR [[GOS||5]] BENEFIT, THAT THIS IS MERELY A PROPOSED WORKING DOCUMENT FOR A SERIES OF NEGOTIATIONS. [[WE|| 20]] ARE NOT ASKING [[SWAPO ||7]] TO SIGN THIS DOCUMENT AS IS, NOR ASKING [[NORDICS ||6]] TO URGE [[THEM ||7]] TO DO SO. [[WE|| 20]] WOULD HOPE, HOWEVER, THAT [[NORDICS ||6]] COULD COMMEND THIS DOCUMENT TO [[SWAPO ||7]] AS USEFUL WORKING DOCUMENT. [[SWAPO ||7]] WOULD HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ITS CONCERNS ON ALL POINTS DURING ACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS.


4. COMMENT: [[GOS||5]] IS TAKING LONG HARD LOOK AT DRAFT DOCUMENT. [[SWEDES ||5]]  AGREE THAT TIMING IS IMPORTANT, AND, WITH A CONCRETE PROPOSAL IN HAND, THIS MAY BE BEST TIME AS WELL AS LAST CHANCE FOR [[SWAPO ||7]] AND [[SAG ||12 ]]  TO REACH PEACEFUL AGREEMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, [[SWEDES ||5]]  NOTED [[SWAPO ||7]] AVERSION TO USE OF PROXIES ACTING ON BEHALF OF [[WESTERN FIVE ||24]].  [[SILLEN ||2]] MENTIONED ALSO THAT ONLY LAST WEEK [[TANZANIANS || 16]] EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM ABOUT UTILITY OF A [[NORDIC ||6]] APPROACH. QUESTIONS ALSO OCCUR TO [[GOS||5]] REGARDING HOW AND TO WHOM TO MAKE THE APPROACH GIVEN MUDDLED [[SWAPO LEADERSHIP ||7]] SITUATION AT THE MOMENT. [[MFA OFFICIALS || 4]] ARE STILL HAMMERING OUT THESE UNCERTAINTIES AMONG [[THEMSELVES || 4]] AND WILL BE LOOKING TO [[[[ITS || 4]] UN DELEGATION || 17]]  FOR INTERPRETATION OF MOOD IN [[NEW YORK || 18]]. THUS FAR, [[GOS||5]] HAS DISCUSSED [[WESTERN FIVE ||24]] DEMARCHE ONLY WITH [[NORWEGIANS || 19]] AMONG [[FELLOW NORDICS ||6]], AND THEN ONLY TO TOUCH BASE. [[EMBASSY || 20]] WOULD ENCOURAGE [[USUN ||18]] TO BE FORTHCOMING WITH [[SWEDISH DELEGATION || 17]] IN [[NEW YORK|| 21]], ALTHOUGH [[WESTERN FIVE ||24]] CONSENSUS FOLLOWING LATEST SESSION IN [[STOCKHOLM || 22]] IS THAT [[MFA'S ||4]] INITIAL SIGNALS PROVIDE LESS GROUNDS FOR OPTIMISM THAN [[WE|| 20]] HAD HOPED.
