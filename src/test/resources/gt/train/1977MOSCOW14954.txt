SUMMARY: [[THE SOVIETS || 1]] HAV ADOPTED A "WAIT AND SEE" ATTITUDE TOWARD [[PAKISTAN ||2]] . [[OUR || 20]] [[SOVIET || 1]] CONTACTS STATE SITUATION AT PRESENT IS UNPREDICTABLE; OUTLOOK FOR STABILITY IN AT LEAST NEAR TERM IS POOR; [[ZIA'S || 3]] POSITION WITHIN [[THE MILITARY || 4]] IS NOT ASSURED; [[THE SOVIETS || 1]] DESIRE "STABILITY" AND NOT TURBULENCE IN [[SOUTH ASIA || 5]] AS EVIDENCED BY [[SOVIET || 1]] [[TASHKENT || 17]] DIPLOMACY AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF "NORMALIZATION" OF RELATIONS AMONG [[SOUTH ASIAN NATIONS || 5]]. IT AP- PEARS THAT [[MOSCOW || 1]] STILL PREFERS [[BHUTTO ||6]] BUT HAS DECIDED NOT TO BURN [[ITS ||1]] BRIDGES WITH  [[THE MILITARY || 4]] WITH WHICH [[IT || 1]] MAY HAVE TO DEAL IN THE FUTURE. END SUMMARY.


1. [[SOVIET || 7 ]] PRESS COVERAGE: IN THE MONTHS PRECEDING [[BHUTTO'S ||6 ]] MOST RECENT ARREST AND THE ELECTION POSTPONEMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS [[SOVIET || 7 ]]  MEDIA COVERAGE MAINTAINED A ROUGH BALANCE IN CONCERN OVER [[BHUTTO ||6]]  ON THE ONE HAND AND TOWARD [[THE MILITARY || 4]] ON THE OTHER. STILL, REPORTS HELD THAT "THE PERIODS OF CIVILIAN RULE WERE MOST FAVORABLE AND FRUITFUL FOR [[PAKISTAN || 22]], "AND FOCUSED ON THE "GAINS," DURING THE [[BHUTTO ||6]] YEARS, IN DOMESTIC POLICY (GROWTH OF PUBLIC SECTOR) AND FOREIGN POLICY (WITHDRAWAL FROM [[SEATO || 8]],  DOWNGRADING [[CENTO ||9]], "NORMALIZATION" OFRRELATIONS IN [[THE SUBCONTINENT ||10]]). FOL- LOWING [[BHUTTO'S ||6 ]] ARREST, THE ALREADY LIMITED TREATMENT OF [[PAKISTAN ||  22]] IN THE SOVIET PRESS HAS DROPPED TO SHORT, FACTUAL NEWS COVERAGE.


2. [[SOVIET ||1]] PRIVATE COMMENTS: [[[[MFA SOUTH ASIA DEPARMENT || 21]] OFFICIAL I... KARCHENKO || 11]] STATED OCTOBER 3 THAT CUTBACK IN [[SOVIET || 7]] PRESS COMMENTARY REFLECTS [[MOSCOW'S || 1]] READING THAT FUTURE POLITICAL TRENDS IN [[PAKISTAN || 22]] ARE UNPREDICTABLE AT THE PRESENT TIME.  


[[CHIEF, [[PAKISTAN- BANGLADESH SECTION || 23]] AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF [[THE ORIENTAL STUDIES INSTITUTE || 13]] Y.V. GANKOVSKIY || 14]] 


IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION ECHOED [[KARCHENKO'S || 11]] INTERPRETATION OF THE [[SOVIET || 1]] POSITION. [[GANKOVSKIY  || 14]] HELD THAT [[MILITARY ||4]] SUPPORT FOR [[GENERAL ZIA || 3]] IS NOT ASSURED. RE- SENTMENT LINGERS AMONG OLDER OFFICERS OVER [[BHUTTO'S ||6]]  DECISION TO PROMOTE [[THE YOUNGER ZIA ||3]] OVER THEIR HEADS. THESE OLDER OFFICERS ARE AWARE OF [[ZIA'S ||3]] FAMILY TIES TO THE CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS POLI- TICIANS AND MAY ALSO RESENT [[ZIA'S ||3]]  PARTISAN APPROACH IN TAKING [[THE MILITARY ||4]] BACK INTO POLITICS. SOME ENTERTAIN PRO-[[BHUTTO || 6]] SYMPATHIES.


3. [[GANKOVSKIY  || 14]] ATTRIBUTED [[PAKISTAN'S ||2]] PRESENT PREDICAMENT TO IN- TERNAL INSTABILITY NOW COMPOUNDED BY ECONOMIC LOSS OF FIFTY MIL- LION DOLLARS STEMMING FROM THE RIOTS. ("THIS IS A LOT FOR [[PAK- ISTAN|| 2]] "). [[HE || 14]] ALSO HELD THAT "FOREIGN INTERFERENCE" IS PARTLY TO BLAME, AND INDIRECTLY IMPLICATED [[THE US || 15]] BY MENTIONING [[BHUTTO'S ||6]]  INABILITY TO ACQUIRE [[US || 24]] ARMS.  [[GANKOVSKIY  || 14]]  THOUGHT THAT THE INTERNAL INSTABILITY IN [[PAKISTAN || 22]] WILL NOT END SOON, AND ADDED THAT DISUNITY IN [[THE MILITARY ||4]], AND [[THE PNA || 16]] AND [[BHUTTO'S ||6]]  POLITICAL SHREWDNESS DO NOT RULE OUT [[BHUTTO'S ||6]]  EVENTUAL RETURN TO POWER.


4. ADDRESSING A QUESTION ON [[SOVIET || 1]]   INTERESTS IN THE AREA, [[GANKOVSKIY  || 14]]  FIRST SOUGHT TO DISCREDIT CONCERNS OVER [[MOSCOW || 1]]-DELH || 18]]- [[KABUL || 25]] "ALLIANCE" MOVING IN ANY PINCER ACTION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF [[PAKISTAN'S ||22]] PRESENT INSTABILITY. [[HE || 14]] EMPHASIZED THAT [[THE SOVIET UNION ||1]] STRONGLY DESIRES STABILITY AND NOT CONFLICT IN [[ITS||1]]  "SOFT UNDER- BELLY". THIS WAS EVIDENCED BY [[ITS ||1]] EFFORTS LEADING TO THE 1966 [[TASHKENT || 17]] AGREEMENT AND [[ITS || 1]] SUPPORT FOR THE "NORMALIZATION" OF RELATIONS AMONG [[THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTH ASIA || 5]] .


5. COMMENT: [[OUR || 20]] READING HERE IS THAT [[THE SOVIETS || 1]]  HAVE ADOPTED A "WAIT AND SEE" ATTITUDE ON [[PAKISTAN || 22]] . [[MOSCOW || 1]]  CLEARLY IS WARY OF REPEATING ITS [[INDIAN || 18]] BLUNDER BY BACKING THE WRONG HORSE, AL- THOUGH [[IT || 1]]   CLEARLY PREFERS [[BHUTTO ||6]]  TO [[THE PNA || 16]] AND [[THE MILITARY ||4]] . HOWEVER, [[IT || 1]]   WOULD NOT LIKE TO LOSE WHAT LITTLE POSITION [[IT || 1]]   HAS ESTABLISHED IN [[PAKISTAN ||22]] OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND [[IT ||1]] IS AWARE THAT THE EVENTS IN 1971 AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE TAUGHT [[THE PAKISTANIS || 2]] THAT THEY CANNOT IGNORE "THE OTHER SUPERPOWER". THE PRESENT [[SOVIET || 1]]  POSTURE UNDERLINES [[SOVIET || 1]]  INTENTION NOT TO BURN BRIDGES WITH [[THE MILITARY ||4]], WITH WHICH [[THE SOVIET UNION || 1]]  WILL HAVE TO DEAL.
