1. [[THE CONSULATE || ]]  HAS OBTAINED A COPY OF THE CONFIDENTIAL MINUTES OF THE AUGUST 26 MEETING IN [[LAGOS || 2]] WHICH LAUNCHED THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT -- NOW [[THE NATIONAL PARTY OF [[NIGERIA || 2]] (NPN || 3]]). REVIEWING THE MINUTES ONE CONCLUDES THE MEETING MUST HAVE RESEMBLED THE CHAOS AT THE CHECK-IN COUNTER AT THE DOMESTIC TERMINAL IN [[LAGOS || 2]]. SOME PRESENT OBJECTED BECAUSE THEY "REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHY THEY WERE AT THE MEETING" AND EVERYONE WAS APPARENTLY BUSY QUESTIONING EVERYONE ELSE'S CREDENTIALS. THE INITIAL MEETING FINALLY RECESSED FOR 30 MINUTES TO ALLOW MEMBERS TO SORT THINGS OUT. EVEN AFTER RECONVENING THERE WERE FOUR SEPARATE LISTS OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM [[IMO ||  4]] AND TWO FROM [[ANAMBRA || 5]] *


2. THE NORTHERN FLAVOR OF THE MEETING WAS QUITE APPARENT FROM THE INTRODUCTORY STATEMENTS BY THE CHAIRMAN, "THIS MEETING IS THE CULMINATION OF A LONG PROCESS WHICH BEGAN WITH THE DECISION OF ALL FORMER POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE FORMER NORTHERN REGION TO DISOLVE AND WORK TOGETHER FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST . . ." TO THE PRESENTATION OF WORKING PAPERS FROM THE "[[THE STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE GENERAL MEETING OF [[THE NORTHERN STATES ||7]] || 6]]". [[WE ||1]]  ARE POUCHING TEXT OF MINUTES UNDER COVER OF AN AIRGRAM.


3. [[WE ||1]] CONCLUDE FROM [[OUR ||1] REVIEW OF THE MINUTES THAT [[WAZIRI IBRAHIM'S|| 8]] AMBITION TO SPLIT [[THE NPN || 3]] (REF A) COULD BEAR FRUIT SINCE UNITY WAS NOT THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF THE MEETING.


4.  [[OUR ||1] EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY THE FLOW OF FOREIGN MONEY INTO NORTHERN POLITICAL ACTIVITY HAVE NOT BORNE MUCH FRUIT SO FAR. ASIDE FROM [[LIBYAN ||9]] CONNECTION ON WHICH [[EMBASSY || 12]] AND [[CONSULATE  || 1]] HAVE REPORTED [[EGYPT || 10]]  AND [[SAUDI ARABIA || 11]]  STRIKE US AS OTHER POSSIBILITIES. IN [[EGYPT'S ||10 ]]  CASE WE CAN ONLY POINT TO THE ANOMALOUS PRESENCE IN THE NORTH OF A [[CONSULATE GENERAL IN [[KADUNA || 2]] || 12]]  WITH TWO OFFICERS AND A [[CULTURAL CENTER IN [[KANO  || 2]] || 14]] WITH FOUR OFFICERS. FROM CONVERSATIONS WITH OFFICERS OF TWO ORGANIZATIONS [[WE || 1]]  CONCLUDE EITHER [[THEY || 15]] ARE DOING LITTLE WITH GROSS OVERSTAFFING OR [[THEY || 15]]  ARE INVOLVED IN ACTIVITIES WHICH [[THEY || 15]]  DO NOT WISH TO DISCUSS.[[ THE CULTURAL CENTER'S || 14]] PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO "ENCOURAGE THE STUDY OF ISLAM AND [[ ARABIC ||16 ]]."


5. IN [[THE SAUDI CASE  || 11]], [[WE  || 1]] HAVE FOUND EVEN LESS CONNECTION [[WE  || 1]]  CAN IDENTIFY. [[ECON OFFICER BRADLEY  || 17]] DID SEE NUMEROUS SHIPPING CASES FROM [[SAUDI ARABIA| 11]] IN THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS OF [[JAMA'ATU NASRIL ISLAM || 18]] -- WOULD YOU BELIEVE COPIES OF THE KORAN -- BUT [[WE  || 1]]  HAVE SEEN NO OTHER EVIDENCE OF [[SAUDI || 11]] ACTIVITY. IF [[OUR || 1]] MEMORY IS CORRECT, CURRENT [[[[SAUDI || 20]] AMBASSADOR IN [[ LAGOS || 2]] || 19]] , WHO RECENTLY MADE VISIT TO THE NORTH (REC C), WAS INVOLVED IN RELIGIOUS POLITICS DURING [[HIS|| 19]]  SOJOURN IN [[ EGYPT ||10]].


6. RE [[PAUL UNONGO || 21]] (PARA 4 REF A), [[KADUNA || 2]] REPORTED IN MAY THIS YEAR THAT  [[UNONGO || 21]] WAS ALLEGEDLY NINE MILLION NAIRA IN DEBT TO [[HIS UNONGO || 21]] VARIOUS CREDITORS AND WAS REPORTEDLY BEING PRESSED TO PAY FROM [[HIS || 21]] REPORTEDLY UNPROFITABLE ENTERPRISES.
