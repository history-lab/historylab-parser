1. ENTIRE TEXT LOU.

2. [[DEPARTMENT||2]] CONCURS WITH THE GENERAL POINTS MADE IN REF A. [[[[US||4]] DELEGATION||3]] TO [[IAEA||5]] GENERAL CONFERENCE DECEMBER 4-11 IN [[NEW DELHI||6]] WILL BE PREPARED TO COMMEND [[IAEA||5]] SUPPORT OF INFCE IN CONNECTION WITH [[THE DIRECTOR GENERAL'S||7]] REPORT AS SUG- GESTED IN PARA 2 OF REF A. [[DEPARTMENT||2]] WILL WANT TO USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS INFCE WITH MANY COUNTRIES IN THE MARGIN OF THE GC ALONG THE LINES OF SUGGESTIONS IN PARAS 3-5 OF REF A, THOUGH FOR THE TIME BEING [[WE||2]] WANT TO RESERVE JUDGEMENT ON YOUR SUGGESTION IN PARA 5 THAT [[BONDI||8]] BE PUT FORWARD AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE PLENARY PRESIDENCY. [[WE||2]] WILL ALSO HAVE A VARIETY OF OTHER BILATERALISSUES TO DISCUSS, AND WILL BE CONSIDERING WHETHER INFCE RELATED DISCUSSIONS SHOULD BE SEPARATE OR COMBINED WITH THESE.

3. CONCERNING THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OCTOBER [[TCC||9]] MEETING (REFS B AND C), [[DEPARTMENT||2]] BELIEVES THAT AN OCTOBER MEETING PROBABLY IS NOT FEASIBLE, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE THE [[CHAYES||10]] SECOND DRAFT OF [[THE TCC||9]] "SUMMARY AND OVERVIEW" IS UNLIKELY TO BE CIRCULATED UNTIL EARLY OCTOBER. IT MAY, HOWEVER, BE DESIRABLE TO SCHEDULE AN ADDITIONAL [[TCC||9]] MEETING SOMETIME AFTER THE NOVEMBER SESSION AND BEFORE THE FINAL INFCE PLENARY CONFERENCE.

4. SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO [[US||2]] BY [[DR. CHRIS PATERMANN||11]] ([[FRG||12]]) DURING [[HIS||11]] RECENT VISIT TO [[WASHINGTON||13]] THAT AN INFCE [[TCC||9]] MEETING MIGHT BE HELD AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE [[IAEA||5]] GENERAL CONFERENCE. WHILE [[WE||2]] HAVE NO FIRM VIEW AT THIS TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR AN ADDITIONAL [[TCC||9]] MEETING, POSSIBLE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL WORK ON [[THE TCC||9]] "OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY" AND/ OR PREPARATIONS FOR THE INFCE PLENARY CONFERENCE MAY PROVE TO BE VALID REASONS FOR HOLDING A [[TCC||9]] MEETING IN CONJUNC- TION WITH THE [[IAEA||5]] GENERAL CONFERENCE.
