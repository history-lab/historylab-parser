1.[[ I ||1]] MET WITH [[DAYAN ||2]] LATE THIS AFTERNOON (JANUARY 6) AT [[HIS||2]] HOME TO CONVEY THE PROPOSED [[EGYPTIAN || 3]] AGENDA FOR THE [[JERUSALEM ||4]] CONFERENCE (REF A) AND TO REVIEW THE SUBSTANCE OF [[THE PRESIDENT'S || 7]] CONVERSATIONS WITH [[THE SAUDIS ||5]] AND [[HUSSEIN || 6]] (REFS B AND C). (FYI. [[ I ||1]]  ERRED ON THE SIDE OF PRUDENCE IN SELECTING THOSE ELEMENTS OF [[THE PRESIDENT'S || 7]] CONVERSATIONS TO SHARE WITH [[HIM ||2]].) [[ELLIE RUBENSTEIN ||8]] AND [[DCM || 15]] WERE ALSO PRESENT. [[DAYAN ||2]] EXPRESSED SPECIAL APPRECIATION FOR [[OUR || 11]] EFFORTS IN KEEPING [[THE ISRAELIS||9]] INFORMED OF DEVELOPMENTS OF THE PAST WEEK AND SAID [[HE ||2]] WOULD BE BRIEFING BEGIN IN DETAIL ON [[OUR || 10]] CONVERSATION TOMORROW MORNING.


2. [[WE ||10]] DISCUSSED AT LENGTH THE SUBJECT OF AN AGENDA FOR THE [[JERUSALEM ||4]] CONFERENCE. AFTER READING A COPY OF THE [[EGYPTIAN || 3]] PROPOSAL [[ I ||1]] HAD GIVEN [[HIM||2]], [[DAYAN||2]] (WHO WAS IN RARE FORM TODAY) SMILINGLY OBSERVED THAT IF [[HE||2]] WERE [[THE SECRETARY ||13 ]], [[HE||2]] WOULD DELAY [[HIS||2]] ARRIVAL FOR A WEEK OR SO "UNTIL THE REAL CONFERENCE STARTS. OTHERWISE [[HE|| 13]] WOULD JUST BE WASTING [[HIS ||13]] TIME LISTENING TO [[ISRAELIS || 9]] AND [[EGYPTIANS || 3]] ARGUE INTERMINABLY OVER WHAT [[THEY||14]] ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT." [[DAYAN'S||2]] MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THE [[EGYPTIAN || 3]] AGENDA PROPOSAL CENTERS PRINCIPALLY ON THE [[PALESTINIAN || 12]] QUESTION. [[HE ||2]] THINKS THAT UNLESS THE FOCUS CAN BE CHANGED THE CONFERENCE IS DOOMED BEFORE IT STARTS BECAUSE [[THE EGYPTIANS || 3]] NEITHER HAVE A MANDATE NOR THE DESIRE TO NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF [[THE PALESTINIANS || 12]]. AS [[HE||2]] PUTS IT, "IN A SHORT TIME [[THE EGYPTIAN'S ||3]] WILL FIND [[THEY ||3]] ARE MAKING NO PRO- GRESS AND YET [[THEY ||3]] WON'T BE ABLE TO LET GO (SIC)."


3. THIS LED [[HIM||2]] TO WORRY ALOUD AT SOME LENGTH ABOUT HOW TO INVOLVE [[HUSSEIN || 6]] IN THE TALKS. [[HE ||2]] SAID THAT FROM WHAT [[ISRAELIS ||9]] HAD RECEIVED FROM [[US || 11]] ABOUT [[HUSSEIN’S || 6]] VIEWS IT SEEMED TO [[HIM||2]] THAT [[HUSSEIN || 6]] HAD DECIDED NOT TO COME IN UNTIL THE MAIN LINES OF A FULL SETTLEMENT WERE CLEAR. WHEN THE DEAL WAS SET ON [[ISRAELI || 9]] WITHDRAWAL, A FORMULA FOUND TO HANDLE THE [[PALESTINIAN ||12]] PROBLEM, AND THE [[JERUSALEM||3]] CONUNDRUM WAS UNRAVELLED, THEN [[HUSSEIN || 6]] WOULD PLAY. [[DAYAN’S ||2]] RESPONSE TO THIS WAS THAT IT JUST IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THIS WAY AND THE SOONER [[HUSSEIN || 6]] REAL- IZES THIS THE BETTER FOR ALL OF US.


4. [[ I ||1]] TOLD HIM THAT [[ I ||1]] COULD NOT AGREE WITH HIS CHARACTERIZATION OF [[HUSSEIN’S || 6]] CURRENT POSITION. [[ I ||1]] SAID [[WE || 11]] BELIEVE [[HE || 6]] IS MOVING CLOSER TO JOINING THE NEGOTIATIONS, BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT BEFORE [[HE || 6]] CAN [[HE || 6]] NEEDS THE ACCEPTANCE OF TWO PRINCIPLES (SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO [[SADAT || 16]]): WITHDRAWAL AND SELF-DETERMINATION FOR PEOPLE IN THE [[OCCUPIED TERRITORIES || 17]]. [[DAYAN ||2]] RESPONDED BY RESUR- RECTING [[OUR ||10]] CONVERSATION YESTERDAY WITH [[BEGIN ||18]] ON THE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MARRY THE [[PRESIDENT'S|| 7]] [[ASWAN || 19]] PHRASE "ENABLE [[THE PALESTINIANS || 12]] TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DETERMINATION OF [[THEIR ||12]] OWN FUTURE" WITH LANGUAGE DRAWN FROM 242 ON WITHDRAWAL. [[HE ||2]] WONDERED IF [[THE EGYPTIANS || 3]] MIGHT NOT BUY A GENERAL FORMULA WHICH WOULD CONSIST OF TWO PARAGRAPHS:
1) QUOTING 242 LANGUAGE ON WITHDRAWAL ("THE WAY [[WE ||14]] AGREED IN [[ISMAILIA ||19]]")
2) LINKING THE [[PRESIDENT'S|| 7]] [[ASWAN || 19]] PHRASEOLOGY WITH THE LANGUAGE USED IN THE [[US||20 ]]-[[ISRAEL || 9]] WORKING PAPER ON THE PARTICIPATION OF [[THE PALESTINIANS || 12]].


5. [[DAYAN ||2]] SAID [[HE || 2]] WANTED TO THINK FURTHER OVER NIGHT ABOUT THIS AND ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUBMITTING A REVISED, MUCH SHORTER PROPOSED AGENDA TO [[THE EGYPTIANS || 3]]. [[HE || 2]] HAS IN MIND POSSIBLY ONLY TWO PRINCIPAL ITEMS -- A DECLARATION GOVERNING THE PRINCIPLES LEADING TO A SOLUTION TO THE [[PALESTINIAN || 12]] ISSUE -- POLITICAL ASPECTS OF AN [[ISRAELI || 9]]/[[EGYPTIAN || 3]]PEACE TREATY (THIS BEING A GRAB BAG FOR EVERYTHING EITHER SIDE WANTED TO THROW INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS.).


6. [[DAYAN ||2]] SAID [[HE || 2]] WOULD BE DISCUSSING ALL THIS IN THE MORNING WITH [[BEGIN|| 18]] AND WOULD BE BACK TO [[US|| 11]]. [[HE || 2]] BROKE OFF [[OUR ||10]] CONVERSATION TO CALL [[BEGIN|| 18]] WHO RELAYED A MESSAGE TO [[ME ||1]] THAT [[HE || 2]] PROBABLY WOULD WANT TO SEE [[ME ||1]] TOMORROW EVENING "FOR A DISCUSSION PRIOR TO THE SUNDAY MORNING [[CABINET || 21]] MEETING."
