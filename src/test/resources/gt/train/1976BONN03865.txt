1. DURING [[MY ||1]] CONVERSATION MARCH 8 WITH [[ECONOMIC COOPERATION MINISTER BAHR || 2]], [[HE || 2]] INDICATED [[HE || 2]] HAD NO RECENT INFORMATION CONCERNING DEVELOPMENTS IN [[EGYPT ||3]].


2. [[BAHR || 2]] SAID [[HE || 2]] STILL HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT THE [[EGYPTIAN||3]]  ECONOMY WAS NOT OPERATING EFFICIENTLY. [[THE FRG || 4]] PLANS BILATERAL TALKS WITH [[THE EGYPTIANS||5]] IN MAY, AND [[THE GERMANS || 4]] ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING A REVIEW OF PROJECTS. [[HE || 2]] SAID THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF NEW MONEY. [[HE || 2]] NOTED [[THE EGYPTIANS  || 5]] HAD ALREADY DRAWN DOWN THE DM 130 MILLION ($50 MILLION), WHICH WAS COMMITTED LAST YEAR. SINCE [[THE EGYPTIANS  || 5]] ARE SHORT OF CASH, [[HE || 2]] SAID [[THEY|| 5]] MAKE HASTE TO SPEND ANY MONEY [[THEY|| 5]] GET AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.


3. [[I || 1]] MENTIONED THE REPORTS THAT [[SADAT || 6]] WOULD BE VISITING [[THE FRG|| 7]] LATER THIS MONTH. SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, [[BAHR || 2]] SEEMED ONLY VAGUELY AWARE THAT THIS VISIT WOULD TAKE PLACE AND DID NOT GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT [[[[HIS||2]]  MINISTRY ||8 ]] WAS SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF TIME PREPARING FOR IT BEFOREHAND. IT MAY, HOWEVER, BE THAT THE VISIT IS BEING INITIALLY HANDLED IN OTHER MINISTRIES OR BY [[THE CHANCELLERY ITSELF || 9]] , AND [[BAHR || 2]] MIGHT NOT BE INTIMATELY INVOLVED AT THIS STAGE.
