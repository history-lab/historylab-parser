1. AFTER THE THUNDER AND SHOUTING AROUND [[BELFAST || 1]] THE PAST TWO WEEKS, IT IS REFRESHING TO PERCEIVE A SCINTILLA OF BRILLIANCE IN THE GLOOM : THE MAJOR [[UNIONIST || 14]] PUBLICATION LOOKS WITH FAVOR ON PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN [[NI ||5]] MAJORITY AND MINORITY.


2. IN AN EDITORIAL ENTITLED "A NEW DEAL NEEDED," [[BELFAST'S || 1]] "NEWS LETTER" ([[UNIONIST || 14]] ) AUGUST 27 COMPLIMENTED THE PROVINCE'S THREE [[EURO-MPS || 16]] FOR HAVING FOUND COMMON CAUSE IN LOBBYING [[THE EEC || 2]] TO PREVENT A CLOSEDOWN OF THE LOCAL COURTAULDS PLANT (SUPPOSEDLY THREATENED BY CHEAP [[AMERICAN || 3]] ARTIFICIAL FIBERS PRODUCED FROM LOW COST  [[AMERICAN || 3]]  PETROLEUM). THE PAPER SAID THAT THE FACT THEY GOT TOGETHER DESPITE THEIR RIVALRY ON POLITICAL ISSUES, WAS "THE FIRST HOPEFUL BREAK IN THE DEADLOCK" OF YEARS BETWEEN THE MAJOR [[NI ||5]] PARTIES.


3. THE EDITORIAL DEVELOPED THIS THOUGHT IN SAYING THAT THE CHILLY BLAST OF [[TORY || 4]] ECONOMIC POLICY MEANS [[NI || 5]] CAN NO LONGER DEVOTE TIME AND ENERGY TO SUPPORTING "POLITICAL DOG FIGHTS" THAT DO NEITHER MAJORITY NOR MINORITY ANY GOOD. THE PAPER HOPED THAT THE POLITICIANS INVOLVED IN TALKS WITH [[SECRETARY OF STATE ATKINS || 6]]  REALIZE THAT CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES, AND THAT RADICALLY CHANGED ATTITUDES ARE NEEDED. THE MEETING OF THE THREE [[EURO-MPS || 16]] IS THE EXAMPLE FOR ALL TO FOLLOW.


4. THE BURIAL OF [[MOUNTBATTEN || 7]] HAVING CONCLUDED THE TRAUMA THAT BEGAN AUGUST 27, THE "NEWS LETTER" RETURNED TO THE THEME SEPTEMBER 7. A SECOND EDITORIAL GREETED FAVORABLY INDICATIONS THAT THE TWO MAJOR SOUTHERN [[IRISH  || 1]] PARTIES HAVE DECIDED TO PUT ASIDE  [[IRISH  || 1]]  UNITY AS FIRST PRIORITY, AND GRANT TO [[THE NI MAJORITY ||5]] THE RIGHT TO DECIDE [[ITS||5]] FUTURE BY CONSENT. THEREFORE, WITH "POLITICAL DURESS" FROM THE SOUTH AND [[LONDON || 8]] NOT TO BE REPEATED, THE STAGE IS SET FOR THE VARIOUS [[NI || 5]] PARTIES TO WORK OUT, IF POSSIBLE ON THEIR OWN, "A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN MAJORITY AND MINORITY." OF COURSE, "WHEN THIS IS ACHIEVED," IT WILL BE FOUND THAT [[THE IRA || 9]] WILL STILL REJECT [[THE NORTH'S  ||5]] RIGHT OF CONSENT WITH GUN AND BOMB.


5. COMMENT: TWO EDITORIALS DO NOT PRODUCE A NEW [[NI ||5]] GOVERNMENT ACCEPTABLE TO MAJORITY AND MINORITY, BUT SENTIMENTS OF THIS SORT FROM SIGNIFICANT [[UNIONIST  SPOKESMEN || 14]] ARE SO RARE THEY SHOULD BE NOTED. WE NOTE ALSO THAT THE SECOND EDITORIAL COINCIDED WITH THE GATHERING OF  [[OFFICIAL UNIONIST LEADERS || 14]] TO CHOOSE A NEW LEADER [[VICE HARRY WEST || 10]], AND WITH THE PAPER' S COMMENDATORY REPORTING OF [[SECRETARY VANCE' S ||11]] SEPTEMBER 5 COMMENTS ON [[NI ||5]] ([[STATE|| 12]] 234546).
