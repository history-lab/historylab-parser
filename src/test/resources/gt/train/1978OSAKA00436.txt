[[[[LDP || 1 ]] CANDIDATE MINORU UEDA || 2]], IN A VIRTUAL DUPLICATION OF THE CONSERVATIVE VICTORY IN THE [[KYOTO || 3]] GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION APRIL 9, DEFEATED [[JCP || 4]] AND MIDDLE-ROAD- ALLIANCE OPPONENTS APRIL 23 TO HOLD FOR [[THE LDP || 1 ]] THE UPPER HOUSE SEAT WHICH [[HAYASHIDA || 5]] VACATED TO RUN SUCCESSFULLY FOR GOVERNOR. ONLY 41 PERCENT OF FLIGIBLE VOTERS CAST VOTES FOR UPPER HOUSE, COMPARED WITH OVER 67 PERCENT IN ELCTION FOR GOVERNOR. PATTERN OF RESULTS WAS NEVERTHELESS QUITE SIMILAR, WITH [[UEDA || 2]] HAVING MARGIN OF 108,000 OVER [[JCP || 4]]  NOMINEE, WHO IN TURN LED THE ALLIANCE CONDIDATE BY 120,000. DESPITE IMPORTANCE WHICH THIS ELECTION MUST BE ASSUMED TO HAVE HAD FOR THE OPPOSITION GROUPS, GIVEN THE CHANCE OF HOLDING THE UPPER HOUSE MAJORITY EVEN BRIEFLY (THERE ARE TWO MORE CACANCIES), NEITHER THE [[JCP || 4]]  NOR THE ALLIANCE COULD GET OUT THE VOTE, EACH DROPPED 45 PERCENT FROM ITS APRIL 9 TOTAL. [[LDP || 1 ]] VICTORY VINDICATES STRATEGY OF [[KYOTO || 3]] PARTY LEADERSHIP IN INSISITING ON RUNNING A SEPARATE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR AND STRENGTHEENS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BOOST FOR [[THE LDP || 1 ]] IN [[KYOTO || 3]]  AND [[KANSAI || 6]]. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT APPEARS TO LEAVE TH MIDDLE ROAD ALLIANCE ([[JSP || 11]], [[KOMEITO || 7]] , [[SHAMINREN || 8]] AND [[DSP || 9]] ) IN SHAMBLES LOCALLY, AND IN PARTICULAR WILL INTENSIFY DOUBTS AS TO [[JSP || 11]] TACTICS AS EFFECTIVE LEADER OF THE ALLIANCE IN [[ KYOTO || 3 ]].
