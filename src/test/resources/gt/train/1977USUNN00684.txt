1.[[ CHARTER REVIEW COMITE ||4]] MET IN PLENARY AM MARCH 8 TO DISCUSS AGAIN ANNEXATION OF L/12 ("[[MEXICAN || 1]] LIST") TO [[COMITE || 4]] REPORT. [[SPAIN || 2]] BEGAN BY ARGUING THAT ANNEXATION OF L/12 IS NOT CONTRARY TO [[COMITE || 4]]  MANDATE. [[FRANCE || 3]]  STRESSED STRANGE PROCEDURE USED BY CO-SPONSORS OF L/12 IN THAT THEY SAID, IN A SPECIAL PLENARY, THAT L/12 CONTAINED NOTHING NEW AND THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO DISCUSS THIS DOCUMENT THIS YEAR; THEN THEY ASKED FOR ANNEXATION. [[[[FRENCH || 3]] DEL || 5]] SAID THAT THUS L/12 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED ONLY FOR ANNEXATION; THIS CAN ONLY MISLEAD [[GA ||6]] INTO THINKING [[COMITE || 4]] HAS DONE SOMETHING THAT [[IT || 4]]  HASN'T. MOREOVER, THE LISTING OF CO-SPONSORS ONLY FOR ONE PART OF THREE- PART DOCUMENT SEEMS TO VIOLATE NORMAL [[UN || 7]] PROCEDURES.




2. [[CHINA || 8]]  SUPPORTED ANNEXATION. [[CHPRUS || 9]]  SUGGESTED THAT COMPROMISE COULD BE REACHED BY ANNEXING ONLY PART I WHICH RELATES TO PROPOSALS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE CHARTER CHANGES. [[POLAND || 10]]  QUESTIONED WHY CO-SPONSORS OF L/12 HAD EMBARED ON METHOD OF WORK WHICH IGNORED CONSULTATION AND NEGOTIATION, AND WHY THEY HAD PUT [[CHAIRMAN ||30]] INTO DIFFICULT POSITION BY ASKING FOR A RULING FROM THE [[CHAIR ||30]]. [[[[POLISH || 10]] DEL || 27]]  SUGGESTED THAT [[COMITE ||4]]  REPORT MENTION THAT L/12 HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO  [[COMITE ||4]].




3. [[KENYA ||11]] SUPPORTED ANNEXATION, SAYING THAT L/12 DOES NOT PRECLUDE ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS, BUT ONLY COMPILES AND CONFIRMS PROPOSALS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE. [[EL SALVADOR || 12]] SPOKE IN FAVOR OF ANNEXATION, AS DID [[NIGERIA ||13 ]], [[ALGERIA || 14]], [[ITALY || 15]], [[SIERRA LEONE || 16]], [[BRAZIL || 17]], [[ROMANIA || 18]], [[SPAIN || 19]], [[TURKEY || 20]] AND [[ECUADOR || 21]]. [[[[FRG || 22]]  DEL  || 28 ]] RECOG- ZINED VALIDITY OF QUESTION RAISED REGARDING L/12 AND SAID, WHILE [[[[HIS|| 28 ]] DELEGATION|| 29 ]] WOULD NOT VOTE AGAINST ANNEXATION, [[THEY|| 29 ]] HOPEFUL THAT COMPROMISE COULD BE REACHED WITHOUT VOTE. [[BELGIUM ||23 ]] OPPOSED ANNEXATION, AS DID [[GDR || 24]] AND [[USSR ||25 ]].




4. [[US || 26]] SAID ARGUMENT FOR ANNEXING ONE OF THE MANY DOCUMENTS OF [[THE COMITE || 4]] ISSUED IN THE "L" SERIES WAS UNPERSUASIVE AND RISKED MISLEADING [[GA || 6]]. SAID NO ONE TRYING TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM EXPRESSING OR RECORDING THEIR VIEWS AND SUGGESTED INFOR- MAL NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE PROBLEM OF HOW BEST TO HANDLE MATTER ON FAIR AND ACCURATE BASIS ALL COULD ACCEPT.




5. [[CHAIRMAN BROMS || 30]] THEN DELIVERED BITING INTERVENTION CON- CERNING CALL BY SOME DELEGATIONS FOR RULING FROM [[THE CHAIR ||30]] TO ANNEX L/12. [[HE ||30] SAID THAT ANNEXATION IS CLEARLY ISSUE THAT MUST BE DECIDED BY [[THE COMITE ||4]], AND THAT IF [[HE ||30]] MADE A RULING  [[HE ||30]] WOULD BE EXCEEDING [[HIS ||30]] POWERS. [[HE ||30]] SAID THAT [[HE ||30]]  COULDN'T APPROVE OF SUCH A MANEUVER, AND THEN CHARGED THAT "[[ONE OF THE SPOKESMEN FOR THE CO-SPONSORS ||31]]" HAD APPROACHED [[HIM ||30]]  THE PREVIOUS DAY AND TOLD [[HIM ||30]]  THAT IF [[HIS ||30]]  RULING DIDN'T COMPLY WITH THE WISHES OF THE CO-SPONSORS, THEY WOULD CHALLENGE THE RULING IN [[COMITE || 4]] AND OVERTURN IT. [[BROMS || 30]] SAID [[HE ||30]]  COULD ONLY TERM THIS APPROACH A THREAT AND STATED THAT [[HE ||30]]  WAS SHOCKED THAT SUCH A STATEMENT WOULD COME FROM [[THE RESPRESENTATIVE OF A [[COUNTRY || 1]] 31]]  WITH WHICH [[HE ||30]]  ([[BROMS ||30]] ) HAD WORKED AND CO-OPERATED WITH FOR MAY YEARS IN [[THE UN ||7]]. [[HE ||30]]  NOTED THAT [[COMITE || 4]] HAD NEVER TAKEN A VOTE AND EXPRESSED HOPE THAT COMPROMISE COULD AGAIN BE REACHED IN THIS CASE.




6. WORKING GROUP MET PM MARCH 8 AND QUICKLY APPROVED FIRST SECTION OF REPORT TO [[COMITE || 4]] . WORKING GROUP WILL MEET AFTERNOONS OF MARCH 9 AND 10 TO COMPLETE REPORT, WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED IN FINAL PLENARY MORNING OF MARCH 11. COMMENT: FOLLOWING [[BRONS' ||30]]  DRAMATIC OUTBURST CONCERNING ACTIONS OF [[[[MEXICAN || 1]]  DEL (BASSOLS) || 31]], IT BEGAN TO SEEN LIKELY THAT COMPROMISE MIGHT BE POSSIBLE ON BASIS EQUAL TREATMENT FOR ALL DOCUMENTS IN THE "L" SERIES.
