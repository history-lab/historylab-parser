1. REQULAR SOURCE REPORTED EXCHANGE OF FIRE EARLY EVENING SEPT. 30 IN [[DAMASCUS ||1]] NEAR [[MILITARY||2]] CONSCRIPTION OFFICE BETWEEN AUTHORITIES AND UNIDENTIFIED ELEMENTS. SOURCE OBTAINED INFO FROM MERCHANT WHOSE SHOP IN THIS VICINITY. ANOTHER SOURCE REPORTED SHOOTING NEAR RESTAURANT ACROSS STREET FROM LOCAL CINEMA EVENING OCT. 3.


2. REGULAR SOURCE MENTIONED PARA ONE SAID HE HAS HEARD REPORTS OF SHOOTING IN SOME [[MILITARY|| 2]] CAMPS BETWEEN SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF [[PES. ASAD. || 3]] 


3. SAME SOURCE STATED THAT THERE IS WIDESPREAD FEELING IN [[DAMASCUS || 1]] THAT [[PALESTINIANS || 4]] OR [[IRAQIS || 5]] PLANNING INCIDENTS TO DISRUPT [[ARAB || 6]] OLYMPIC GAMES, WHICH BEGIN OCT. 7 (WELCOMING CEREMONY ATTENDED BY [[ASAD || 3]] AND [[TOP SARG LEADERSHIP ||7]] TOOK PLACE AT LOCAL STADIUM EVENING OCT. 6). MASSIVE SECURITY PREPARATIONS WERE BEING TAKEN TO FORESTALL VIOLENCE (NOTE: [[AMEBASSDOR || 21]] WHO ATTENDED OPENING FESTIVITES NOTED [[SECURITY PERSONNEL || 9]] OUT IN FORCE) [[WE || 8]] UNDERSTAND THAT FIVE INDIVIDUALS DETAINED SEVERAL DAYS AGO FOR ATTEMPTING TO PLACE BOMBS AT MAIN STADIUM TO BE USED FOR COMPETITION.


4. ANOTHEH RUMOR PURPORTS THAT EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN [[ALEPPO || 1]] AROUND OCT. 5 IN WHICH THIRTEEN LOCAL [[BAATH PARTY OFFICIALS || 10]] KILLED OR INJURED. BLAST ALLEGEDLY IN RETALIATION FOR EXECUTION OF [[ALEPPINE ||1]]  CHARGED WITH PLANTING IN [[SYRIA||1]] ([[DAMASCUS ||1]] 6754). 


5. [[WE ||8]] CONTINUE TO HEAR REPORTS, FROM MAANY RELIABLE SOURCES, THAT MORE TROUBLE EXPECTED IN [[NORTHERN SYRIA ||11]]. [[AL-BAATH || 10]] COLUMNIST HAS PER- SISTENTLY ADVISED [[EMBOFF || 21]] THAT ARMS FLOWING INTO [[ALEPPO|| 1]] AREA IN PREPARA- TION FOR [[ANTI-REGIME || 7]] DISTURBANCES. REGULAR SOURCE CITED PARA ONE SAYS MANY [[DAMASCENES|| 1]] BELIVE INTERNAL TENSIONS MORE DIFFICULT TO SURPRESS IN [[ALLEPPO|| 1]] THAN IN [[DAMASCUS|| 1]]; LATTER, HE NOTES, HAS BEEN BLANKETED BY SECURITY APPARATUS. THIS SOURCE SAID HE LEARNED FROM WELL-INFORMED [[BAATHIST || 10]] OFFICIAL THAT [[EGYPT||12]] HAD SENT [[FORMER SECURITY CHIEF ABD AL- HAMID SARRAJ || 13]] TO [[LEABNON ||14]] TO REACTIVATE [[HIS|| 13]] OLD NETWORK OF CONTACTS IN [[SYRIA ||1]], MANY OF WHOM LOCATED IN [[HAMA||1]]. [[[[GOVT. || 7]] CRITIC AND [[MFA || 16]] OFFICIAL HAMOUD AL-SHOUFI || 15]] TOLD [[EMBOFF ||21]] OCT. 6 THAT [[[[SYRIAN || 7]] INTELLIGENCE || 17]] BELIEVES [[SARRAJ|| 13]] HAS BEEN IN [[LEBANON ||14]] BUT IS HOLDING THIS INFO TIGHLTY. [[HE || 15]] ADDED THAT [[HE|| 15]] UNDERSTANDS WEAPONS ARE MOVING INTO [[NORTHERN SYRIA || 11]], AND LISTED [[IRAQ ||18]] AND [[EGYPT || 12]] AS SUPPLIERS.


6. COMMENT: REPORTS OF BOMB EXPLOSIONS, IN [[OUR ||8 ]] EXPERIENCE, EARIER TO VERIFY THAN SHOOTING INCIDENTS. TENSIONS RUNNING HIGH IN [[SYRIAN CITIES ||1]] AND [[SECURITY PERSONNEL ||9]] UNDERSTANDABLY JITTERY; SOME "INCIDENTS" MAY IN FACT BE DISTORTED VERIONS OF ACCIDENTAL FIRING BY PERVASIVE [[SECURI TY FORCES ||9]]. REPORT OF SHOOTING IN [[MILITARY ||2]] CAMPS, IF TRUE, WOUD INDICATE [[ASAD ||3]] STILL HAS SOME PROBLEMS WITH [[[[HIS ||3]] ARMY || 19]]. INFLUX OF ARMS INTO [[NORTHERN SYRIA ||11]], ALONG WITHRELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF REPORTED EXPLOSIONS IN PAST MONTH IN [[ALEPPO || 1]], INDICATES [[[[SYRIAN || 7]] SECURITY ||9]] FINDING DIFFICULTY IN CONTROLLING VIOLENCE IN [[NORTH ||11]], IN CONTRAST TO PROGRESS MADE IN [[DAMASCUS ||1]] TO UNCOVER SABOTAGE NETWORKS. EVEN IN [[ALEPPO||1]] SOME SUCCESSES HAVE BEEN SCORED BY [[AUTHORITIES ||7]], AS DEMONSTRATED BY PROSE- CUTION OF TWO LOCAL CITIZENS MENTIONED PARA 4 AND HANGING OF ONE EARL IER THIS WEEK. [[WE||8]] HAVE NO INFORMATION THAT OPPOSITION ELEMENTS IN [[ALEPPO||1]] STRONG ENOUGH TO OPENLY DEFY [[DAMASCUS ||1]] AUTHORITY AS WAS CASE IN EARLY SIXTIES, BUT MORE VIOLENCE CAN PROBABLY BE EXPECTED.


7.[[ RSO || 20]] AND [[AMBASSADOR || 21]] HAVE CAUTIONED [[EMBASSY PERSONNEL || 8]] TO TAKE PROPER PRECAUTIONS IF ATTENDING [[ARAB || 6]] GAMES COMPETITIONS.
