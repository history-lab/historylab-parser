1. INTRO AND SUMMARY. IN COURSE OF PAST 48 HOURS, A NUMBER OF [[EMPLOYEES|| 18]] OF [[RL [[RUSSIAN || 2]] SERVICE || 1]] HAVE RECEIVED COPIES OF AN ANONYMOUS [[RUSSIAN || 2]]-LANGUAGE LETTER WHICH CLEARLY SEEMS TO BE DESIGNED TO EXACERBATE EXISTING ANIMOSITIES BETWEEN [[STATION'S || 1]] OLDER AND NEWER [[[[RUSSIAN ||2 ]]-EMIGRE EMPLOYEES || 3]]. [[THE EMPLOYEES'  || 3]] INITIAL REACTION TO LETTER SEEMS REASONABLY RESTRAINED. THERE IS, HOWEVER, SOME POSSIBILITY THAT TEXT OF LETTER COULD BE BROUGHT TO ATTENTION OF NEWS MEDIA OR OTHER OUTSIDE INSTITUTIONS IN MANNER WHICH COULD HAVE UNFAVORABLE REPERCUSSIONS FOR [[RFE/RL || 1]]. END SUMMARY.
 
2. FOLLOWING IS INFORMAL TRANSLATION OF TEXT OF [[RUSSIAN || 2]]-LANGUAGE LETTER WHICH WAS SENT VIA LOCAL [[FRG  || 4]] MAIL TO AN AS YET UNDERTERMINED NUMBER OF [[RL [[RUSSIAN || 3]] SERVICE EMPLOYEES || 18]], SOME OF WHOM ARE [[JEWS  || 5]] WHO WERE PART OF "THIRD EMIGRATION." BEGIN TRANSLATION: THE PREVAILING ATMOSPHERE AT [[THE STATION || 1]] SEEMS TO REFLECT A WELL-PLANNED EFFORT BY [[THE FEDOSEEYEVS || 11]], WHO ARE [[KGB AGENTS || 7]], TO STIR UP ANTI-[[RUSSIAN || 3]] SENTIMENTS. THE WHOLE [[[[RUSSIAN  ||2 ]] SERVICE || 1]] IS SUFFERING FROM FEVER AND AN ATMOSPHERE OF NERVOUSNESS AND EXHAUSTION PREVAILS. WHAT HAS THE "THIRD WAVE" OF THE EMIGRATION WASHED UP ON TO THE BANKS OF [[RL || 1]]? VARIOUS KINDS OF GARBAGE SUCH AS THE PLAGIARIZER MAY, [[THE [[KGB  || 7]]  AGENT (CHEKHIST) MATUSOVICH  ||12 ]] (SIC), [[THE PROSTITUTES BELOTSERKOVSKY AND LOVETSKAYA || 13]], [[THE PROVOCATEUR ROITMAN ||14 ]], AND [[THE WOMANIZER GALICH || 15]], WHO HAD [[HIS || 15]] OWN WIFE SHUT UP IN A NUTHOUSE. WHAT HAVE THESE PEOPLE GIVEN US BUT SLANDER AND PROVOCATIONS WHICH HAVE DISTURBED THE WORKING ATMOSPHERE AT [[RL || 1]]* THE NEWLY ARRIVED LEADERS OF [[RL || 1]] ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO PREVENT THE CAMPAIGN OF WHOLESALE SLANDER DIRECTED AT [[EMPLOYEES||18]] OF LONG STANDING. THE LEADERSHIP COMPOSES MEMORANDA DESIGNED TO CALM THE SITUATION INSTEAD OF RESTRAINING THE RUSSOPHOBES AND RESTORING NORMAL WORKING ATMOSPHERE AT [[THE STATION || 1]]. ENOUGH* THE TIME FOR COOPERATION AND APPEASEMENT IS PAST* [[WE || 17]]  WILL ANSWER THE BLACKMAIL OF [[THE MATUSEVICHES || 12]], [[LODEESENS || 16]] AND [[FEDOSEEYEVS || 11]] AND THE DOVE-LIKE COOING OF THE TOP MANAGEMENT WITH RESOLUTE ACTIONS* (SIGNED) "[[RUSSIAN NATIONALS ||17]]". END TRANSLATION.


3. AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT LETTER REPRESENTS EFFORT BY OUTSIDE FORCES. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE COPY OF LETTER WAS SENT TO [[BORIS LITVINOV || 6]], [[A FORMER [[RL || 1]] EMPLOYEE WHO HAS BEEN DEAD FOR SEVERAL MONTHS || 6]]. THIS COPY WAS SENT TO AN ADDRESS WHICH IS NINE MONTHS OUT OF DATE.


4. PORTIONS OF LETTER WHICH REFER TO NEW [[RL MANAGEMENT || 1]] [[HERE  || 4]] SUGGEST THAT AUTHOR(S) CONCLUDE THAT NEW MANAGEMENT HAS SUCCEEDED IN DEFUSING THE TENSIONS WITHIN [[[[RUSSIAN  ||2 ]] SERVICE || 1]] WHICH THREATENED LAST WINTER TO GET OUT OF CONTROL.


5. ALTHOUGH IT IS TEMPTING TO SPECULATE THAT [[KGB || 7]] MAY HAVE PLAYED ROLE IN CIRCULATION OF LETTER, [[WE || 8]] HAVE NO EVIDENCE AT PRESENT TO SUPPORT SUCH SPECULATION. [[RL MANAGEMENT  || 1]] HAS BROUGHT LETTER TO ATTENTION OF APPROPRIATE [[BAVARIAN AUTHORITIES || 9]].


6. HEAVY-HANDED NATURE OF TEXT, FACT THAT COPY OF LETTER WAS SENT TO [[A DECEASED EMPLOYEE || 6]], AND RL MANAGEMENT'S RESTRAINED REACTION SEEMED TO HAVE COMBINED TO EXERT CALMING EFFECT ON [[EMPLOYEES OF [[RUSSIAN  ||2 ]] SERVICE || 18]].


7. ALTHOUGH LETTER ITSELF MAY NOT BE SEXY ENOUGH TO GENERATE INTERESTING NEWSPAPER COPY, THERE IS ALWAYS SLIGHT POSSIBILITY THAT MEDIA COULD USE LETTER AS PEG ON WHICH TO HANG UNFAVORABLE STORY ABOUT PROBLEMS AT [[RL || 1]].
