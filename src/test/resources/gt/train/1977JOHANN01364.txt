SUBECT: BLACK NEWSPAPER SERIES ON [[US ||1 ]] COMPANIES--[[KELLOGG ||2]] CASE


1. SECOND ARTICLE IN SERIES BY [[ZULUBOY MOLEFE || 3]] IN BLACK AUDIENCE NEWSPAPER [[THE WORLD ||4 ]] (SECOND LARGEST DAILY IN [[SOUTH AFRICA || 5]] ) ON  [[US ||1 ]] COMPANIES IN [[SOUTH AFRICA || 5]] FOCUSES INTER ALIA ON ATTEMPTS BY [[THE SWEET FOOD AND ALLIED WORKERS UNION (SFAW) || 6]] TO ORGANIZE AT THE [[KELLOGG ||2]] PLANT.


2. WITH THE SIX POINT STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES OF SEVERAL [[AMERICAN ||1]] FIRMS PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED IN THIS AS IN EACH OTHER ARTICLE [[THE AUTHOR|| 3]] QUOTES [[THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF [[THE SFAW) || 6]] LEONARD "SKAKES" SIKHAKANE || 7]] AS FOLLOWS:


QUOTE OF COURSE [[WE) || 6]] HAVEN'T APPROACHED [[AMERICAN ||1]] COMPANIES ON FORMAL BASIS FOR RECOGNITION. BUT THEN THE FEW [[WE) || 6]] HAVE TALKED TO HAVE SAID THEY DID NOT NEED UNIONS, SAID [[MR SIKHAKANE || 7]].
QUOTE [[HE || 7]] THEN PAINTED A DISTRUBING PICTURE OF THE TROUBLE [[[[HIS || 7]] UNION|| 6]] HAD WITH [[THE [[SPRINGS || 5]]-BASED KELLOGG COMPANY || 2]], WHERE [[HE || 7]]  CLAIMED THAT A MAJORITY OF [[THE UNION'S  || 6]] 150 MEMBERS WERE BASED.
QUOTE AS EARLY AS 1975, SAID [[MR SIKHAKANE || 7]], [[[[HIS || 7]] UNION|| 6]] HAD APPROACHED [[THE KELLOGG MANAGEMENT ||2]] WHICH HAS A LIAISON COMMITTEE OPERATING AT [[THE FACTORY ||2]. BUT IT WAS LAST YEAR THAT [[THE UNION|| 6]] MADE EFFORTS AND PUSHED HARD FOR RECOGNITION AND IT MET A LOT OF RED TAPE".
QUOTE [MR SIKHAKANE || 7]] ALSOSAID THAT WHEN [[HE|| 7]] MET [[THE FACTORY'S MANAGEMENT ||2] [[HE|| 7]]  WAS TOLD THAT [[ITS ||2] BLACK WORKERS WERE RECEIVING FRINGE BENEFITS. [[HE|| 7]] WAS ALSO TOLD, [[MR SIKHAKANE || 7]] FURTHER ALLEGED, THAT [[THE KELLOGG MANAGEMENT ||2]] TOLD [[HIM || 7]]  THAT [[THEY ||2] OPERATED UNDER A WAGE DETERMINATION OF [[THE WAGE BOARD ||19]].
QUOTE AS [[I || 7]] AM TALKING TO YOU YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF SHOP STEWARDS IN THAT [[FACTORY ||2]] HAVE BEEN DISMISSED FOR THEIR TRADE UNION ACTIVITIES. DEFINITELY [[KELLOGG ||2]] IS NOT COOPERATING WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE UNIONISM FOR ITS BLACKS, [[HE|| 7]] WENT ON.
QUOTE HERE ARE THE STORIES THE DISMISSED [[KELLOGG ||2]] WORKERS TOLD [[ME|| 3]]  DURING INTERVIEWS IN [[SPRINGS || 5]]: --[[MRS JANE LEKHULENI (20) || 8]], WHO WAS A SHOP STEWARD AT [[THE FACTORY ||2]]. "[[I || 8]] WAS DISMISSED ON FEBRUARY 21 THIS YEAR. A WHITE SUPERVISOR THREATENED [[ME || 8]] WTH DISMISSAL SINCEJANUARY. THIS WAS BECAUSE [[I || 8]] HAD DEMANDED THAT A WORKERS COMMITTEE BE ESTABLISHED AT [[THE FACTORY ||2]].
QUOTE "IN FACT [[OUR ||6]] PROBLEMS AT [[THE FACTORY ||2]] STARTED ABOUT DECEMBER 20 LAST YEAR WHEN [[WE||6]] HAD ELECTIONS AND [[WE||6]] UNANIMOUSLY VOTED FOR A WORKS COMMITTEE. A [[DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR OFFICIAL || 9]] WAS PRESENT WHEN THESE ELECTION WERE HELD."
QUOTE AFTER THAT A BLACK PERSONNEL MANAGER TOLD [[ME || 8]] THAT IF [[I || 8]] DID NOT WANT A LIAISON-COMMITTEE, [[I || 8]]  HAD TO LOOK FOR WORK ELSEWHERE.
QUOTE--[[MR PANKIE MASHAPA (33) || 10]], WORKED AS A CREW LEADER AT [[THE FACTORY ||2]] AND WHEN DISMISSED WAS EARNING R43,50 PER WEEK: "[[I || 10]] WAS DISMISSED ON APRIL 3 THIS YEAR. THE SAME MORNING A SUPERVISOR TOLD [[ME|| 10]] THAT [[I || 10]] HAD BEEN DEMOTED TO ANOTHER MACHINE. IT WAS THEN [[I || 10]] DEMANDED A BETTER WAGE FOR THE NEW JOB [[I || 10]] HAD TO DO.
QUOTE IN DECEMBER A WHITE SUPERVISOR WANTED TO KNOW WHY [[I || 10]] HAD JOINED A TRADE UNION. HE MADE A THREAT THAT [[I || 10]] WOULD BE DISMISSED FOR THAT.
QUOTE--[[MISS SELINAH SKHOSANA (23) || 11]] WORKED AS A SACKER ATTENDANT EARNING R16,60 PER WEEK WHEN [[SHE || 11]] WAS DISMISSED IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR: "IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR [[I || 11]] WAS INFORMED BY OUR SUPERVISOR THAT [[I || 11]] WOULD BE WORKING THE 2 TO 11 P.M SHIFT.
QUOTE "[[I || 11]] REFUSED BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE VERY INCONVENIENT FOR [[ME || 11]]. [[I || 11]] STAY IN A ROUGH AREA OF [[KWA THEMA TOWNSHIP || 12]] KNOWN AS "REST- IN-PEACE". THE SUPERVISOR INSISTED THAT [[I || 11]] WORK THE SHIFT OR CONSIDER [[MYSELF || 11]] DISMISSED.
QUOTE: AT THIS STAGE THE WORKERS WHO WERE TALKING TO [[ME || 3]] WERE JOINED BY A UNION OFFICIAL WHO TOLD [[ME || 3]] THAT SHE AND A WHITE TRADE UNIONIST, WHO HAS SINCE BEEN BANNED BY [[THE GOVERNMENT || 13]], WENT TO SEE [[THE FACTORY'S MANAGEMENT || 2]] ABOUT THE DISMISSAL, AND WERE INFORMED THAT [[MANAGEMENT || 2]] WAS NOT AGAINST TRADE UNIONS FOR ITS BLACK WORKERS."
QUOTE IN AN INTERVIEW WITH [[MR D.A. WOOD MANAGING DIRECTOR OF [[KELLOGGS ||2]] || 14]] ON THE WORKERS' ALLEGATIONS [[HE || 14]] TOLD [[ME ||3]] THAT THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THE STORIES.
QUOTE"THE WHOLE THING DISTURBED [[ME || 14]]. [[I || 14]] AM TRYING TO MEET [[THE [[UNION’S|| 6]] SECRETARY, MR LEONARD DIKHAKANE || 7]] . WHAT [[I || 14]] CAN SAY NOW IS THAT [[OUR COMPANY ||2]] HAS NEVER RESTRICTED WORKERS FROM JOINING TRADE UNIONS", [[HE || 14]] ADDED.
QUOTE [[I  ||3 ]] HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT [[MR WOOD || 14]] HAD NEVER MET [[MR SIKHAKANE || 7]] AND THAT THE MATTER OF THE DISMISSED WORKERS HAS ALSO COME BEFORE [[THE LEGAL CLINIC OF THE URBAN TRAINING PROJECT ||16]], A SERVICE ORGANISATION CATERING FOR BLACK TRADE UNIONS, AND THAT THE WORKERS HAVE GIVEN STATEMENTS.
QUOTE AT THE MOMENT [[THE SWEET FOOD AND ALLIED WORKERS" UNION || 6]] THROUGH [[THE LEGAL CLINIC || 16]], WAS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST [[KELLOGG ||2]] ON BEHALF OF THE DISMISSED WORKERS. END QUOTE.


3. COMMENT: IN A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH [[THE REGIONAL LABOR OFFICR ||9]], [[SIKHAKANE || 7]]  CONFIRMED THAT THE "WHITE TRADE UNIONIST" REFERRED TO IN [[MOLEFE'S ||3]] ARTICLE IS [[LOET DOWES DEKKER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF [[THE URBAN TRAINING PROJECT || 16]] || 15]], WHO WAS BANNED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER TRADE UNION LEADERS INCLUDING [[[[AMERICAN || 1]] CITIZEN JEAN TYACKE || 17]] IN NOVEMBER 1977. [[SIKHAKANE || 7]]  CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUFFICIENT GROUNDS EXIST FOR PURSUING A CHARGE OF WORKER VICTIMIZATION AGAINST [[KELLOGG ||2]] IN THE [[SOUTH AFRICAN || 5]] COURTS AND HAS ASKED [[THE URBAN TRAINING PROJECTS' LEGAL CLINIC || 16]] TO TAKE SUCH ACTION.
