1. THERE FOLLOWS AN ACCOUNT PROVIDED BY [[FRENCH DELEGATION || 1]] OF A RECENT CONVERSATION BETWEEN [[THE [[FRENCH || 2]] AMBASSADOR IN [[TIRANA || 4]] || 3]]  AND [[[[ALBANIAN || 5]] DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS NUSHI || 6]] ON THE CESSATION OF [[PRC || 7]] AID TO [[ALBANIA || 5]] .


-
2. BEGIN [[FRENCH || 8]] PAPER
-
-
[[NUSHI || 6]] INDICATED THAT [[TIRANA|| 5]]  WILL SOON MAKE KNOWN DETAILS ON THE CESSATION OF [[CHINESE || 7]] AID TO [[ALBANIA || 5]]  BY PUBLISHING DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL SHOW THAT [[CHINA || 7]] IS ALONE RESPONSI
-
BLE FOR THE DETERIORATION OF STATE AND IDEOLOGICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.
-
[[HE || 6]] SAID THE [[CHINESE ||7]] DECISION HAD NOT BEEN A SURPRISE FOR [[ALBANIA || 5]]. [[ALBANIA || 5]] HAD BEEN EXPECTING IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE TIME WHEN [[PEKING || 7]]  HAD EXERTED PRESSURES ON [[ALBANIA || 5]] WHICH WOULD HAVE LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE COMMON MARKET AND WITH [[THE US || 9]] IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS. [[ALBANIA || 5]] HAD OPPOSED THIS, AS IT HAD OPPOSED PRESSURE TO "MUZZLE" [[HER|| 5]].
-
ACCORDING TO [[NUSHI || 6]], [[CHINA || 7]]  TRIED TO HINDER [[ALBANIA || 5]] FROM CRITICIZING [[CHINESE ||7]]  FOREIGN POLICY, NOTABLY AFTER THE 1971 [[NIXON || 10]] MEETING WITH [[MAO TSE-TUNG || 11]] AND AFTER TRIPS BY [[KISSINGER ||12]] TO [[PEKING || 7]] . [[HE || 6]]  STRESSED THAT NO COUNTRY COULD SUBMIT [[ALBANIA || 5]] TO SUCH PRESSURE: "[[ALBANIA || 5]] AND ITS PARTY ARE AND WILL REMAIN FREE AND WILL NEVER DEVIATE FROM TRUE [[MARXIST || 13]]- [[LENINISM || 14]]."
-
A LARGE COUNTRY LIKE [[CHINA || 7]]  SHOULD NEVER CONDUCT [[ITSELF ||7]] AS [[IT ||7]] HAD JUST DONE WITH A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE [[ALBANIA || 5]], BUT [[THE CHINESE ||7]]  DECISION DID NOT BOTHER [[ALBANIA || 5]], WHICH HAD FORESEEN THE DECISION AND HAD TAKEN MEASURES IN GOOD TIME TO DEAL WITH IT. HOWEVER, [[NUSHI || 6]] RECOGNIZED THAT IT IS NOW NECESSARY TO PAY HIGHER PRICES FOR INDISPENSABLE MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND RAW MATERIALS WHICH [[PEKING || 7]] HAD SOLD, NOT ONLY AT PREFERENTIAL PRICES, BUT ALSO WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ASSISTANCE (THAT IS TO SAY, ON CREDIT). [[NUSHI || 6]] SAID WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CON- FIDENCE THAT [[ALBANIA || 5]] IS CAPABLE OF COMPLETING UNFINISHED PROJECTS, EVEN THE ELBASSAN STEEL MILL.
-
ACCORDING [[THE CHINESE ||7]] DECISION, BUT HAD NOT THOUGHT, APPARENTLY, THAT THE DECISION WOULD BE TAKEN SO SOON. END TEXT.
