1. FOLLOWING VISIT OF [[[[ETHIOPIAN || 1]] FOREIGN MINISTER FELEKE GEDLE-GIORGIS || 2]]  (ON WHICH [[WE || 3]] WILL BE REPORTING SEPARATELY), [[FOREIGN MINISTER FORLANI || 4]] GAVE INTERVIEW, PUBLISHED MARCH 3 IN [[CORRIERE DELLA SERA || 5]], IN WHICH [[HE || 4]] DESCRIBED [[THE ETHIOPIANS || 1]] AS STILL INTRANSIGENT, APPROVED THE [[BRZEZINSKI || 6]] STATEMENT ON [[SOVIET || 7]] ACTIVITY IN [[THE HORN || 8]] AND SALT, AND CRITICIZED [[THE US ||9]] FOR NOT TAKING SUCH A STAND EARLIER. SPECIFICALLY, [[FORLANI|| 4]] MADE FOLLOWING POINTS:
-- [[THE ETHIOPIANS || 1]]  REMAIN INTRANSIGENT ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS AND WILL NOT BEGIN TALKS UNTIL [[ETHIOPIAN ||1]] SOVEREIGNTY IS REESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT [[NATIONAL TERRITORY || 1]]. [[FONMIN ||2]] REASSURED [[FORLANI ||4]] THAT BORDERS WOULD NOT BE CROSSED.
-- [THE ETHIOPIANS || 1]]  ARE "VERY SATISFIED" WITH THE VISIT OF [[[[US || 9]]  REPRESENTATIVE DAVID AARON ||  11]]. [[THEY ||1]] REGRET THAT [[ITALY || 12]] HAS NOT SO FAR CONDEMNED THE AGGRESSION AGAINST [[ETHIOPIA || 10]]. [[ITALIANS || 12]] EXPLAINED [[THEY|| 12]] HAD NOT DONE SO BECAUSE [[THEY|| 12]] WANT TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH [[BOTH SIDES || 14]].
-- [[THE ETHIOPIANS || 1]] SAID THAT NO ONE SHOULD DOUBT [[THEIR || 1]] INDEPENDENCE FROM [[SOVIETS ||15 ]] AND [[CUBANS || 16]].
-- [[THE ETHIOPIANS || 1]] OPPOSE RECOURSE TO [[THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL || 17]] AND CONTINUE TO INSIST ON [[THE OAU || 18]] AS THE FORUM FOR PEACE EFFORTS.
-- AS TO [[ERITREA || 19]], [[THE ETHIOPIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ||2]] SAID THAT ONCE PEACE IS REESTABLISHED [[THE GOVERNMENT || 1]] CAN PUT INTO EFFECT THE POSSIBILITY OF [[SELF-GOVERNMENT ||13]] ENVISIONED BY THE CHARTER OF THE [[ETHIOPIAN || 10]] REVOLUTION.
-- AS TO [[BRZEZINSKI'S|| 6]] STATEMENT, IT IS "VERY GOOD, OF TARDY," AND IS IN FACT WHAT [[THE ITALIANS ||12]] HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR SINCE OCTOBER, THAT IS, TO LINK THE SITUATION IN [[THE HORN||8]] TO THE SALT TALKS. [[THE AMERICANS||9]] HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF SAYING CLEARLY TO [[THE SOVIETS || 15]] THAT THEY CANNOT MEET TOGETHER TO REDUCE TENSIONS IF [[THE SOVIETS || 15]] ARE STIRRING UP LOCAL CONFLICTS ALL AROUND. THE PART WHICH [[ITALIANS||12]] AND OTHER [[EUROPEANS || 22]] MUST PLAY IS TO PUSH [[THE SOVIET UNION A|| 15]] ND [[THE US|| 9]]  TO CONSIDER HOW VERY DANGEROUS THE WHOLE SITUATION IS.
-- IF [[THE AMERICANS||9]] HAD AT THE BEGINNING INSISTED ON CONFRONTING THE SITUATION, EMPHASIZING ITS RISKS, RECOGNIZING ITS COMPLEXITY, PERHAPS PUSHING MORE FOR NEGOTIATIONS, IT MIGHT HAVE PERMITTED [[THE SOMALIS || 20]] TO WITHDRAW WITH MORE DIGNITY AND PERHAPS [[THE CUBAN || 16]] INVOLVEMENT MIGHT NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE.


2. COMMENT: [[WE || 3]] ARE PLANNING TO REGISTER (AT [[MFA ||4]] WORKING LEVEL) [[EMBASSY'S ||3]] SURPRISE AT [[FOREIGN MINISTER'S|| 4]]  EQUATING [[US||9]] AND [[SOVIET || 15]] ROLES, AS WELL AS [[HIS|| 4]] IMPLICATION THAT [[WE || 9]] DO NOT CONSIDER THE CONFLICT VERY DANGEROUS, THAT [[WE || 9]] HAVE NOT BEEN VIGOROUS ENOUGH IN PUSHING FOR A SOLUTION, AND THAT [[CUBAN || 16]] INVOLVEMENT IS RELATED TO WHAT [[FORLANI || 4]] CONSIDERS TO BE [[OUR || 9]] INSUFFICIENT EFFORTS. IN CONVER- SATION EARLIER TODAY, WORKING LEVEL OFFICIALS WERE REGISTERING EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT INTERVIEW.
