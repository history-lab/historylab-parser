BEGIN SUMMARY: IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH [[SACEUR ||1]] OVER 28-30 JULY WEEKEND, [[PRESIDENT EANES ||2]] OUTLINED [[HIS ||2]] PLANS TO RESOLVE THE CURRENT [[GOVERNMENTAL || 3]] CRISIS. THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION IS [[ARMA || 4]] WHO WAS PRESENT AS TRANSLATOR FOR THE CONVERSATIONS. END SUMMARY.


1. THE CAUSE OF THE CRISIS. [[THE PS || 5]], AND IN PARTICULAR [[PRIME MINISTER SOARES || 6]], FORCED THE ISSUE WHICH RESULTED IN THE CURRENT CRISIS, BY BEING TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE TO [[CDS || 7]] POSITIONS--ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF AGRARIAN REFORM, [[THE PS || 5]] LEFT THE CDS NO CHOICE OTHER THAN TO RESIGN FROM [[THE GOVERNMENT|| 3]].


IN THE [[PRESIDENT'S ||2]] VIEW, [[HE ||2]] THEN HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO DISMISS [[THE PRIME MINISTER || 6]] AND [[[[HIS || 6]] GOVERNMENT || 3]]. [[HE  ||2]] SAID THAT TO ALLOW [[THE PS || 5]] TO REMAIN IN POWER WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN [[THE PS || 5]] SEEKING OUT [[THE PCP ||8]] FOR SUPPORT IN [[THE ASSEMBLY || 9]]. [[PRESIDENT EANES ||2]] SAID A [[PS|| 5]]/[[PCP|| 8]] VOTING COALITION WOULD RESULT IN LEGISLATION UNACCEPTABLE TO [[THE [[PORTUGUESE ||  10]] PEOPLE|| 11]]. IN ADDITION, [[HE || 6]] WOULD BECOME A "PRISONER OF [[THE PS || 5]]."


2. THE PREFERRED SOLUTION. [[PRESIDENT EANES ||2]] SAID [[HE||2]] WILL MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO FORM ANOTHER GOVERNMENT COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL PARTIES. [[HE||2]] IS AWARE OF THE EXTENSIVE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN THIS AND IS NOT OPTIMISTIC CONCERNING THE SUCCESS OF HIS PLAN. IF [[HE||2]] CANNOT FORM SUCH A GOVERNMENT [[HE||2]] WILL THEN TURN TO [[HIS||2]] SECOND CHOICE--A GOVERNMENT OF TECHNOCRATS OR "PERSONALITIES," WHICH [[HE||2]] BELIEVES WOULD HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF LASTING UNTIL ELECTIONS IN 1980. THE THIRD CHOICE WOULD BE ELECTIONS, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A NEW ELECTORAL LAW AND WOULD PROBABLY DELAY CONSIDERABLY A RETURN TO NORMALCY.


3. [[ARMA || 4]] COMMENT: [[THE PRESIDENT ||2]] WAS OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED, BUT [[HE||2]] IS DETERMINED TO FOLLOW LEGAL AND DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS. A MARK OF [[HIS ||2]] DEDICATION TO DEMOCRACY OCCURRED DURING LUNCH, WHEN [[HE||2]] SAID THAT [[HE||2]] BELIEVES NO MAN HAS THE RIGHT TO BE DICTATOR AND TO IMPOSE [[HIS ||2]] WILL UPON THE PEOPLE. [[HE||2]] SAID THAT "ONLY THROUGH LEGISLATION PASSED BY (DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED) REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE COULD THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE BE PROPERLY REALIZED." [[MRS. EANES ||12]] TOOK ISSUE WITH [[THE PRESIDENT ||2]], AND SAID QUITE FIRMLY THAT [[SHE ||12]] THOUGHT SOME THINGS SHOULD BE IMPOSED UPON THE PEOPLE, FOR THEIR OWN GOOD, AT WHICH POINT A FAMILY DISAGREEMENT BECAME OBVIOUS. HOWEVER, [[THE PRESIDENT ||2]] GOOD-NATUREDLY HELD [[HIS ||2]] GROUND. IN A PRIVATE CONVERSATION [[HE||2]] MADE A SPECIAL POINT OF NOTING [[HIS ||2]] PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP FOR [[PM SOARES ||6]], BUT STATED THAT "THE WELFARE OF [[THE COUNTRY || 10]] MUST COME BEFORE FRIENDSHIP." IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT MOST [[PORTUGUESE || 11]] OPERATE ON TWO RELATIONAL LEVELS. THUS, [[THE PRESIDENT ||2]] MAY REGARD [[SOARES ||6]] AS A FRIEND ON THE PERSONAL LEVEL AND, AT THE SAME TIME, HAVE AN EXTREMELY LOW REGARD FOR [[THE PM ||6]] ON THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL.
