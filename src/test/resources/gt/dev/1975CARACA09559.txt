1. AS [[CU || 1]] AND [[AGENCY || 2 ]] ARE AWARE, [[WE || 3]] HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH [[WASHINGTON || 5 ]] ON A MULTI-COUNTRY "WRITERS IN SOCIETY" SEMINAR FOR WELL OVER A YEAR AND [[THIS POST ||  3]] WAS ENCOURAGED TO HEAR FROM [[[[ILA'S ||  7]] DIRECTOR DILLON ||  8]] RECENTLY THAT PLANS FINALLY APPEARED TO BE WELL UNDERWAY FOR SUCH A SEMINAR IN THE [[UNITED STATES || 4]] IN THE SPRING OF 1976.


2. HOWEVER, [[ WE || 3 ]] ARE NOT RPT NOT AWARE UNTIL [[[[CU'S || 1]] GWEN CLARE|| 9 ]] ARRIVED IN [[CARACAS || 10]] ON CONSULTATION SEPTEMBER 8 THAT [[ USIS [[MEXICO || 12]] ||  11]] WAS DEEP INTO A SIMILAR, HIGHLY IMPRESSIVE PROJECT PLANNED FOR FEBRUARY, 1976, WITH A HIGHLY IMPOSING LIST OF POSSIBLE [[US || 4]] AND [[[[MEXICAN || 12]] PARTICIPANTS || 13]].


3. [[WE || 3 ]] APPLAUD [[ MEXICO'S || 14]] INITIATIVE AND SUGGEST THAT [[ USIS [[MEXICO || 12]] ||  11]], [[CU || 1]] AND [[ ILA || 7]] CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPANDING ITS PROJECT TO INCLUDE ONE DISTINGUISHED WRITER FROM EACH OF THE COUNTRIES SCHEDULED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE [[US || 4]]. SEMINAR. IN FACT, [[WE || 3]] UNDER- STAND THAT [[MEXICO || 14]] ALREADY PLANS TO INVITE [[[[PERU'S || 15]] ]] MARIO VARGAS LOSA || 16]].


4. [[WE || 3]] DO NOT BELIEVE THE [[MEXICAN || 12]]  PROJECT, IF ENLARGED AS SUGGESTED ABOVE, WOULD IN ANY WAY AFFECT ADVERSELY THE CHANCES FOR A SUCCESSFUL LATER PROJECT IN THE [[UNITED STATES || 4]]. QUITE THE CONTRARY, SINCE THE [[MEXICAN || 12]] CONFERENCE COULD PROVIDE [[CU || 1]] AND [[USIA || 17]] WITH VALUABLE EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE MAJOR BICENTENNIAL "WRITERS IN SOCIETY" COLLOQUIUM IN THE [[UNITED STATES || 4]] PERHAPS IN THE FALL OF 1976. [[WE || 3]]  VENTURE TO SUGGEST THAT [[[[HARVARD'S || 18 ]] PROFESSOR JUAN MARISCAL || 19]], [[WHO || 19]] IS A [[  [[GOOD FRIEND OF [[OCTAVIO PAZ || 20]] || 19]], MIGHT BE INVITED TO THE [[MEXICAN ||  12]] CONFERENCE SINCE [[HARVARD || 18]] IS BEING SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED AS A LOCUS FOR THE [[ US || 4]]. GATHERING.


5. [[USIS [[VENEZUELA || 10]] || 21]] WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTION [[IT || 21]] CAN TO THE SUCCESS OF SUCH A VENTURE AND GLAD TO CONSULT WITH [[ MEXICO || 14]], IF THIS WERE DESIRED.
