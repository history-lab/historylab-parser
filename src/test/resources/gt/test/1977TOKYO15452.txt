1. ON 4 OCTOBER A MID-LEVEL [[[[MITI || 3]] CONTACT || 9]] COMMENTED TO [[EMBOFF ||1]] ON [[PRESIDENT CARTER'S || 2]] ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW STUDY GROUP ON STEEL AND SAID [[THE MINISTRY || 3]] STILL FINDS THE [[U.S.|| 4]]  HANDLING OF THIS ISSUE AMBIGUOUS THOUGH [[IT ||3]] SENSES THERE HAS NOW BEEN A SHIFT IN [[THE ADMINISTRATION'S || 4]] ATTITUDE AGAINST INTRODUCING QUANTATIVE RESTRAINTS. [[HE|| 9]] ESPECIALLY WONDERED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF QUANTATIVE RE- STRAINTS IN PERSUADING [[U.S. || 6]] STEEL PRODUCERS TO DROP DUMPING CHARGES AGAINST [[JAPANESE || 7]] PRODUCERS.


2. [[HE|| 9]] STOPPED SHORT OF STATING EXPLICITLY THAT PRODUCERS [[HERE|| 7]] HAVE SOLD PRODUCTS BELOW COST IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET. BUT [[HE|| 9]] CLAIMED STEEL IS JUST ONE AMONG MANY PRODUCTS THAT CURRENTLY APPEAR TO FALL WITHIN THE [[U.S. || 4]] DEFINI- TION OF DUMPING SINCE IT IS NOT UNUSUAL EVEN OUTSIDE [[JAPAN ||7]] FOR EXPORTERS TO TEMPORARILY CUT PRICES BELOW COST WHEN WORLD DEMAND FALLS OFF. [[HE|| 9]] EXPRESSED CURIO- SITY ABOUT SECTION 205 B OF THE [[U.S.||4]] ANTIDUMPING ACT REQUIRING THE USE OF CONSTRUCTED VALUE IN CASES WHERE IT IS DETERMINED PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN SOLD IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET AT PRICES WHICH DO NOT PERMIT RECOVERY OF ALL COSTS WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AND IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF TRADE AND [[HE|| 9]] ASKED FOR DEFINITIONS OF "REASONABLE PERIOD" AND "NORMAL COURSE OF TRADE." [[HE|| 9]] INDICATED MITI HAS FOCUSED ON THIS PROVISION OF 205 B AS PROVIDING A POSSIBLE WAY OUT OF THE REQUIRE- MENT TO USE CONSTRUCTED VALUE AND HE WONDERED WHAT THE REACTION MIGHT BE IN [[WASHINGTON || 10]].


3. [[EMBOFF || 1]] SAID [[HE|| 1]] HAD NO INFORMATION AS TO HOW [[THE TREASURY || 5]] AND [[ITC||8]] DELIBERATIONS MIGHT BE INFLUENCED BY THE EFFECT AND DURATION OF THE ECONOMIC RECESSIONS BUT [[HE||1]] EX- PRESSED A PERSONAL VIEW THAT INVESTIGATORS WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT  [[MITI || 3]] AND INDUSTRY DATA TO SUPPORT CLAIMS THAT PRICE CUTS IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET WERE NOT EX- CESSIVE.


4. COMMENT: [[WE || 11]] INTERPRET THE CONVERSATION TO BE YET ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF EFFORTS ON THE PART OF [[MITI || 3]] TO EXPLORE ALL OPTIONS FOR AVERTING THE ANTIDUMPING PRO- CEEDINGS AND BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH PREVIOUS REPORTING ON THIS ISSUE.
