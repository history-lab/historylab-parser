1. SPEAKING TO NEWSMEN SHORTLY AFTER [[HIS || 1]]RETURN MAY 29 FROM A TWO-DAY VISIT TO [[IRAN || 2]], [[FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE  || 1]] TOUCHED ON THE FOLLOWING TOPICS:


2. [[AFGHANISTAN || 3]]. - [[VAJPAYEE || 1]] DID NOT VISIT [[IRAN || 2]] JUST TO DISCUSS [[AFGHANISTAN||3]]; [[HIS||1]] TALKS WITH [[IRANIAN LEADERS ||4]] WERE PART OF A CONTINUING PROCESS OF CONSULTATIONS AMONG NEIGHBORS. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN [[AFGHANISTAN|| 3]] ARE THE INTERNAL AFFAIR OF [[AFGHANISTAN|| 3]]. NEVERTHELESS, [[HE ||1]] WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, THERE ARE APPREHENSIONS ABOUT A SETBACK TO THE PROCESS OF REGIONAL STABILITY AND COOPERATION. [[INDIA'S || 5]] VIEW IS THAT THE DEVELOPMENTS IN  [[AFGHANISTAN || 3]] NEED NOT BE A SETBACK TO THIS PROCESS. ([[HE ||1]] DECLINED TO NAME THE PERSONS OR COUNTRIES THOUGHT TO BE NEVEROUS OVER EVENTS IN  [[AFGHANISTAN || 3]].) [[INDIA||5 ]] AND [[IRAN || 4]] BOTH SEEK STABILITY, COOPERATION, PRESERVATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND "INTEGRITY" OF ALL STATES IN THE REGION. [[THE SHAH||6 ]]  DID NOT PUT FORWARD -- AS ASSERTED BY WHAT [[VAJPAYEE  || 1]] REPORTEDLY LABELED "TOTALLY BASELESS AND MISCHEIVOUS" NEWS REPORTS -- A PROPOSAL FOR CLOSE [[PAK|| 7]]-[[INDO|| 5]]- [[IRANIAN|| 4]] COOPERATION IN CASE [[THE SOVIET UNION || 8]] MADE [[ITS || 8]] PRESENCE FELT IN THE REGION THROUGH  [[AFGHANISTAN || 3]]. [[VAJPAYEE  || 1]] BELIEVED [[IRAN  || 4]] SHARED THE [[GOI ||5 ]] VIEW THAT [[THE NEW AFGHAN GOVERNMENT || 9]] FACES PROBLEMS COMMON TO ALL [[DEVELOPING COUNTRIES || 10]] AND THAT THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF [[THESE COUNTRIES|| 10]] CAN BE SOLVED BY COOPERATION AND NOT BY CONFRONTATION. ASKED FOR THE [[GOI'S||5]] POSITION REGARDING THE DURAND LINE, [[VAJPAYEE  || 1]] REPORTEDLY REPLIED THAT EXISTING BOUNDARIES SHOULD BE RESPECTED AND ANY DIFFERENCES RESOLVED THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.


3. [[INDO|| 12]]-[[IRANIAN || 2]] RELATIONS. - [[INDIA || 5]] OFFERED TO SELL WHEAT AND SUGAR TO [[IRAN||2]], AND, IN RESPONSE TO AN [[IRANIAN || 4]] COMPLAINT, [[VAJPAYEE  || 1]] PROMISED TO LOOK INTO THE DELAY IN SHIPPING STEEL BILLETS FROM [[INDIA || 12]] TO [[IRAN||2]]. [[IRAN || 4]] RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THE IDEA OF GREATER ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH [[INDIA|| 5]], AND [[PRIME MINISTER DESAI || 13]] MIGHT SIGN SOME ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS DURING [[HIS|| 13]] BRIEF STOPOVER IN [[TEHRAN || 2]] ON JUNE 5. ASKED IF [[THE SHAH || 6]] HAD RAISED THE IDEA OF AN [[ASIAN || 14]] COMMON MARKET, [[VAJPAYEE  || 1]] REPLIED THAT BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS SHOULD PRECEDE MULTILATERAL COOPERATION. RESPONDING TO [[VAJPAYEE ‘S|| 1]] QUESTION ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY [[INDIAN ||12]] BUSINESSMEN IN OBTAINING [[IRANIAN || 4]] VISAS, [[THE IRANIANS || 4]] ASSURED [[HIM|| 1]] THAT [[INDIANS || 12]] WERE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN [[THE IRANIAN GOVERMENT'S || 4]] DRIVE TO HALT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.


4. OUTSIDE INTERVENTION IN BORDER DISPUTES. - [[INDIA|| 5]] AND [[IRAN|| 4]] THOUGHT THAT BORDER DISPUTES IN [[AFRICA || 15]] AND ELSWWHERE SHOULD BE RESOLVED WITHOUT FOREIGN ASSISTANCE. SINCE THERE IS NO DEARTH OF [[FREEDOM FIGHTERS||16]] IN [[AFRICA || 15]], [[INDIA || 4]] SEES NO NEED TO INVITE FOREIGN FORCES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE IN [[SOUTHERN AFRICA ||17]]. ACCEPTING THE LONG-TERM PRESENCE OF FOREIGN TROOPS SHOULD BE AVOIDED BY COUNTRIES COMMITTED TO NON-ALIGNMENT.
