1. PARA. FIVE REFTEL DESCRIBES DIFFICULTIES [[[[U.S. || 1]] DELEGATION TO 1979 WARC || 2]] IS HAVING IN GETTING SUPPORT FOR FREQUENCIES IN 7/8 GHZ BAND NEEDED FOR MOBILE COMMUNICA- TIONS SATELLITE OPERATIONS. THE ALLOCATIONS REQUESTED BY [[THE U.S.||1 ]] ARE A FIRM [[NATO||3 ]] REQUIREMENT.


2. IN COURSE OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE DISCUSSIONS DURING PAST WEEK, [[WE || 4]] BELIEVE [[U.S.|| 1]] HAS NOT RECEIVED SUFFICIENTLY STRONG AND VOCAL REPEAT VOCAL SUPPORT FROM [[[[ITS|| 1]] [[NATO|| 3]] ALLIES|| 5]] FOR RECOGNITION OF MOBILE SATELLITE SERVICE. THIS HAS SERIOUSLY WEAKENED [[OUR || 1]] EFFORTS TO ATTRACT SUPPORT FROM [[NON-[[NATO|| 3]] DELEGATIONS || 6]] WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE EXPECTED TO GO ALONG WITH [[US|| 1]]. IN GENERAL, IT APPEARS THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EXPERTS WHO RUN MOST OF THE [[NATO|| 3]] DELEGATIONS HAVE NOT SUFFICIENTLY APPRECIATED MILITARY REQUIREMENTS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS [[U.S.|| 1]] PROPOSAL.


3. [[USDEL|| 2]] REQUESTS THAT [[THE DEPARTMENT|| 4]] AUTHORIZE [[[[U.S.||1 ]] NATO || 7]] TO CALL A MEETING OF THE POLITICAL DIRECTORS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE NEXT WEEK TO DISCUSS PROBLEM WITH INTENTION OF GETTING A CLEAR CUT DIRECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE TO OTHER [[NATO || 3]] DELEGATIONS AT WARC IN SUPPORT OF [[U.S.|| 1 ]] PROPOSAL OUTLINED IN REFTEL. IF NECESSARY, [[WE || 4]] WILL PROVIDE ONE OR MORE TECHNICAL EXERTS FROM [[THE DELEGATION||2 ]] ON SHORT NOTICE IF  [[[[U.S.||1 ]] NATO || 7]] BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY. [[WARCDEL||2]] TELEPHONE IS (022) 32-09-70, EXTENSION 241.


4. ISSUE EXPECTED TO BE RAISED NEXT WEEK.


5. IT APPEARS THAT SIMILAR PROBLEM MAY EXIST FOR OTHER FREQUENCIES OF IMPORTANCE TO [[NATO||3]]: THE RADIOLOCATION (RADAR) SERVICE ALLOCATIONS SUPPORTING [[U.S.||8]] AWACS AND AEGIS SYSTEMS AND [[U.K.||9]] NIMROD RADAR SYSTEMS IN THE BANDS 3400-3700 MHZ NOTED IN REFTEL; ALSO, THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FIXED AND MOBILE ALLOCATIONS IN 4400-4990 MHZ (TROPOSCATTER SYSTEMS) AND 14.5-15.3 GHZ (AIR-TO-AIR AND AIR-TO-GROUND MOBILE SYSTEMS). WHILE SOME SUPPORT FOR [[ U.S.|| 1]] POSITION HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY [[FRG||10]] AND [[UK||11]], BELIEVE IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE HIGH LEVEL [[NATO ||3]] APPROVAL AND DIRECTION TO [[WARC DELEGATES FROM [[NATO||3]] COUNTRIES || 15]] TO SUPPORT ACTIVELY THESE AND OTHER [[NATO ||3]] FREQUENCY REQUIREMENTS.


6. REQUEST [[DEPARTMENT|| 4]] REPEAT REFTEL TO [[BRUSSELS || 12]].
